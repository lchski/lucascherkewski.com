Hello!

A happy Sunday to you :) Writing, again, at the end of a full but fulfilling weekend. This weekend featured hours in parks, enjoying the grass and the scenery and the quiet—yesterday, visiting some dear friends back in town for a visit with their baby; today, imagining the future and reading with T. Really enjoying this cool weather break—here’s to August, the better part of summer.

- “[Working, humanely](https://www.winstonhearn.com/wrote/2023/working-humanely/)” isn’t something that feels possible some days, and yet there are little pockets of goodness out there—even if only for a time.
- Sharing [a post on learning from incidents](https://unwiredcouch.com/2023/05/06/incident-prevention.html), [Mandy Brown applies its lessons to retrospectives in general](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/learning-over-prevention/).
- A helpful framework for thinking about financial investments: the “[return on hassle spectrum](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/return-on-hassle/)”.
- [Studies on the link between CO2 and cognition are all over the map, suggesting the need for more research](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/we-need-more-research-on-how-co2)—well-explained science interpretation, thank you!!
- I’ve been slowly enjoying the second season of _Star Trek: Strange New Worlds_—episodic content, thank you!!—and don’t have a link to share about it, just to say, it’s good.

All the best for the week ahead!
