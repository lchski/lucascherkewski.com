Hello from dreary Ottawa, where it’s somehow June but certainly doesn’t feel like it. (The heat is coming, which I dislike even more than damp cold, so I won’t complain. Just to say, wow! This weather!)

- Gardening’s been on our mind lately, as we gear up to have another bed on top of those T tended last year. We never quite achieved full self-sufficiency harvests (though some weeks were certainly very abundant), but I’m inspired by this story of [victory gardens in times of crisis](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/victory-gardens-food-tariffs-1.7546210). It includes a fun old American infographic on how to plant a 25x50ft plot to “feed a family of five”. 
- For your beautiful craft quota, check out these [carved bowls by David Fisher](https://davidffisher.com/2025/05/30/walnut-tray-bowl-with-tree-footnotes/). (Wild!)
- [Alan Alda, what a gem.](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/may/26/my-mother-didnt-try-to-stab-my-father-until-i-was-six-alan-alda-on-childhood-marriage-and-60-years-of-stardom) 
- Sean wrote about [18F’s legacy of procurement reform](https://sboots.ca/2025/05/30/18fs-profound-legacy-of-procurement-reform/). Thematically appropriate (though not 18F directly!), I’d add [Mikey Dickerson in conversation with Patrick McKenzie on procurement](https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/fixing-government-technology-with-mikey-dickerson/) and other government topics (the opening on why / how government buys differently than consumers or businesses is succinct and revelatory). 
- I wish I had a more clever extended joke to make with today’s newsletter title, but the [list of HTTP status codes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) has plenty enough clever jokes in it.  

We’re shortly on our way to catch up with some old friends and family. Making time for the right things—doing better at that these past few months. All the best for the week ahead!
