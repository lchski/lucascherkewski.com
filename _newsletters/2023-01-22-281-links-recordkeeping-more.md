Good afternoon! (That’s me, trying to wake myself up as a small food coma combines with a dreary weather day.)

I’ve got some exciting spreadsheets to make today (cost benefit analyses! travel planning!), so will dive right into the links:

- I ate up this [essay on the historical significance of the secretary role](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/secretary-jobs-in-the-age-of-ai), a position of privilege and power once accorded great importance. Some of the observations on recordkeeping and filing are relevant well beyond the “secretary to important person” context: “we use computers, everyone can file their own things, look at the cost savings!” entirely misses the huge productivity costs of self-filing, which is very rarely done well.
- Speaking of recordkeeping and archiving, [two Canadian historians (rightly) call out Canada’s absurd process to access historical government records](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-do-we-have-to-look-abroad-to-understand-canadian-history/) (where little is made open by default, instead requiring an access request and manual review of every file before release), comparing it to [the UK’s, which regularly announces new tranches of 20-year-old files automatically opened to the public](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/news/?news-year=&news-type=document-releases). We accept such mediocrity.
- An [excellent explanation of administrative burdens _meant to expand access_, by Jordan Kyle](https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/when-policymakers-add-administrative). It’s a great explanation of administrative burden generally, where people have to do a bunch to access some benefit or service they’re eligible for, adding a huge (often hidden) cost for (often vulnerable) people to access (often necessary) services.
- [Ben Werdmuller gathers a host of research on how ineffective layoffs are](https://werd.io/2023/layoffs-are-bullshit)—how they give the appearance of doing something economically smart, while devastating workers and hurting the company or organization itself in the long-run.
- [Dan Sinker’s experience of not feeling up to trying for the last few years really rings true.](https://dansinker.com/posts/trying/) Here’s to a year of trying?

All the best for the week ahead!
