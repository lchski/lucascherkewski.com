Hello! In what seems to be a trend, my mood this weekend has been mercurial. Partly, I think a stressful upcoming month at work, but also, as my therapist helpfully pointed out, I seem to fall into this every January. Way out is through, etc etc.

BUT, it’s been great for morale to see the Canal open for skating. I sorely missed the sweet sound of skates cutting ice in recent years; here’s hoping it’s a good season. (Maybe I’ll even get my birthday “walk the full length of the Canal” tradition in? We’ll see!)

- The LA fires have been all over, so no doubt you’ve encountered them one way or another. A few pieces that struck me one way or another:
	- The heartbreaking feeling of [thinking your property is safe, until it isn’t](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/palisades-california-fires-climate-reporter-essay.html).
	- [The fires as an example of the “megaevents” that plague us](https://www.torched.la/zero-percent-containment/), human-initiated or not. ([via Mike Monteiro](https://buttondown.com/monteiro/archive/how-to-get-your-joy-back/))
	- Brian Merchant’s thinking over the course of his [narrative of escaping the fire](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-fires-are-everywhere), the decisions to make and so on. Also, the description and photo of the idle Waymo is so apt.
	- Despite bully pulpit crowing to the contrary, water shortages were a function of [the impossibility of fighting a wildfire with an urban water supply](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/la-wildfires-water-shortage-1.7427014).
- Okay, two more cheery / innocent links:
	- [Simone Giertz’s various clever adaptations and custom builds for her small house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vAiloW7phc) (via [Jack Cheng's latest newsletter](https://www.jackcheng.com/sunday/436-better-messy-than-boring/)).
	- Neat to see [how much is going on with HTML](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/bone-up-html-2025/).

All the best for the week ahead!
