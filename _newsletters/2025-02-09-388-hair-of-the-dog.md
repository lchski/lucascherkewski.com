Friends, I did it! After many years of missing out on Canal ice skating fun (some climate induced, others self-inflicted), I skated the full length yesterday. The soreness after yesterday could only—so I told myself—be helped by going again today, giving me a good few hours skating this weekend. So I’m pleasantly tuckered out, heading into what’ll be a much fuller month than the last.

This will-it-won’t-it-trade-war week, I felt some odd parallels to the early pandemic: waiting to see when and which leaders would take it seriously, and how, though not knowing myself how to act our way out of it; feeling a bit silly and self-conscious while, then, stocking up on household essentials and keeping distance and so on, and, now, checking the labels of items for made-in-Canada and so on.

Okay, onto some links:

When digital government folks emphasize the importance of good delivery, this is it: delivery is what enables policy, _and stopping delivery can shut down policy_, even if that policy remains in place.

For the rest of the weekend, I’ll be either cooking, woodworking, admiring [beautiful chairs](https://duncanellinwood.substack.com/p/ladderback-stick-chair), playing video games, [chuckling at clever posters](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/4-posters-to-hang-in-your-studio), or watching _Star Trek: Lower Decks_. I hope yours is equally as restful—all the best for the week ahead!
