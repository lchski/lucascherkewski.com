Hello there!

I’ve had a bit of an off week, thanks to some health troubles. No alarm bells going off today, but heading in for more checkups tomorrow. Fret not—I’ve managed to find good days and good times to spend with friends, getting out and about. Not everything is heavy!

Nonetheless, I haven’t had as much time to dig into reading or thinking as I normally do. So I’ll just share a few links I’ve accumulated over the past few weeks:

- Mar Hicks publishes their [syllabi on the (gendered) history of computing and critical digital studies](http://marhicks.com/syllabi.html). They’re a blast to read, and not just academic pieces—plenty of good reading/listening/watching to dig into depending on your interest. ([Hicks’s book, _Programmed Inequality_, is a good one.](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/programmed-inequality))
- [Brad Frost wrote about design systems and enterprise software](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-systems-agile-and-industrialization/) and _I am here for it_: “I’ve come to the conclusion that “enterprise web development” is just regular web development, only stripped of any joy or creativity or autonomy.” (Thanks to [Tim](https://twitter.com/timarney) for passing along the link.)
- [Matt Edgar reflects on “20+ years in digital services delivery”](https://blog.mattedgar.com/2020/01/27/delivering-digital-service-this-much-i-have-learned/) with seven thoughtful points, including many links to read more.
- An exercise to carry out with a friend, significant other, or so on: “[36 Qs for increasing closeness](https://www.recipesforwellbeing.org/36-qs-for-increasing-closeness/)”. (Found in [Mita Williams’s](https://twitter.com/copystar) excellent newsletter, [_University of Winds_](https://tinyletter.com/UniversityofWinds).) 

Thanks to everyone who’s stepped in to give me a hand or a kind word this week—I really appreciate it, really appreciate _you_. If all goes well, I’ll be back to my lengthier ramblings in no time. Until then, all the best for the week ahead!
