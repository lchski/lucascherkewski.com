The wholesome social network

What makes a social network? The people in it. 

What determines the tone of a social network, whether it is positive or negative, healthy or toxic? Here, too, the answer might be “The people in it.” Certainly that’s part of the answer. But this is also determined in part by what those people _do_. Through writing short messages, taking photographs, or listening to music—and, importantly, sharing these activities—the people in a social network communicate with one another through whatever medium and format that network offers. This communication, the combination of the people and their activity, informs the network’s tone.

What makes a social network wholesome?

This is a question I’ve wondered about recently. The other week, [I said goodbye to Twitter](https://twitter.com/lchski/status/1084984361647333376) ([again](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/12-bye-bye-birdie/)). The same old reasons—noise, distraction, disquiet. I’ve continued my moderated use of Facebook. I’ve cut away from Instagram entirely. These three networks seem to me unwholesome, neither good for my health nor morally good.

But the other day, I realized that I’ve kept up with one social network that exhibits none of these qualities, a social network that’s quite wholesome. It’s [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/).

Goodreads has a host of features, but just a few main ones. You add books that you want to read or have read to your shelves, you provide updates and reviews on books you’re reading, and you see your friends or other people you follow doing the same. That’s about it.

Other networks have a similarly restricted set of features. On Twitter, you can publish a snippet of text, maybe with an image, and you see your friends or other people you follow doing the same. Again, that’s about it. So why does Twitter repulse me, while Goodreads attracts?

To intentionally oversimplify, I think it’s the implied focus of the two networks. For Goodreads, everything revolves around books. [There’s an outside reference point to which you’re always referring.] Sure, you can provide commentary on world events if you want to—and, sometimes, what you decide to read is its own form of commentary—but in the end you’re socializing in the world of books. On Twitter, by contrast, there’s no shared focal point—you tweet about whatever you want, whether your followers get the reference or not. Twitter is adrift, while Goodreads is grounded in a particular world, the world of books.

This isn’t to hate on Twitter. It is what it is—while I’ve checked out, I was for a long time a big fan. But it _is_ to praise Goodreads, and its single-minded focus on books. Reading is in and of itself a wholesome activity. Seeing what your friends are reading and what they want to read? Also nourishing. Several times I’ve been happy to see a friend reading some favourite book of mine, or commented on the status update of a friend making their way through a book we’d discussed in the past.

What makes Goodreads a wholesome social network for me is its focus on an uplifting external activity. I go to Goodreads for books, and I expect nothing more. I’m similarly a fan of [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/), though I’ve been less successful at keeping up my account there. “The social network for film lovers.” says it perfectly.

All this to say, I’m turning from general purpose social networks to specialized ones, ones that fill my heart with goodness instead of stressing my brain with crappiness. If you’d like to, please [join me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27072166-lucas-cherkewski) or [encourage me to better use Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/lchski/). And, as ever, talking with each other, writing letters, and emailing remain wholesome ways to stay in touch—please do so.

All the best for the week ahead!
