Earlier this week, I was talking through a tricky situation with coworkers. I went to use a favourite slogan from Mike Bracken—“[Be radical in changing how an organisation works, but incremental in changing what it delivers](https://public.digital/2018/09/28/radical-org-change-incremental-delivery-change/)”—before stopping myself.

The phrase captured perfectly what I meant to say, but it paved over nuance. Using just the pithy phrase would do have disserviced the implications of what I meant to say, and risked misunderstanding. Instead, I tried to talk through what I meant from different angles, using several sentences instead of one. Sometimes, it takes more than a catchy slogan to capture what you mean.

I often think of a conversation I had with a friend last winter. She described the documentation she keeps behind each briefing note she writes. For example:

1. 1–2-page briefing note, succinctly summarizing the issue and recommending a course of action
2. 5-page discussion paper, providing more detailed background and rationale
3. 50-page research file, with extensive notes on the problem space

From what I’ve heard around town, this is a pretty common approach. The decision maker gets #1, middle management gets #1 with the added context of #2, and the “working level” folks have #1, #2, and #3. A few observations on this hierarchy:

- The person writing #1, #2, and #3 understands this issue _deeply_
- The shorter format of #1—full of condensed phrases where every word is significant—tries to capture the nuances of #2 and the depth of #3, but inevitably omits some of both
- The person making a decision through #1 thus can’t possibly understand the issue to the same depth as the person making the recommendations, but they also don’t have the time to consume all the information contained in #2 and #3 (or, likely, to explore the significance of each word in each sentence of #1)

The issue I’m working around here is that of communicating depth. How do you convey all that you mean? And can you do it economically? Slogans (which are basically a hipper form of academic theory) are great at first glance, but then you hit the human element and realize that application is harder in practice, and you grasp for more to help your point hit home.

This issue doesn’t just crop up in briefing notes. It’s also the case for teamwork, among other settings. When you work alongside a team day in and day out
