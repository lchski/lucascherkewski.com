We brought some sheets in from the line yesterday; on going to fold them this morning, T found a large cicada nestled in one of them. Now, I’ve been hearing them all afternoon, the slow drone accompanying slow summer days.

I suppose, then, that we’ve officially arrived at the [dog days of summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_days), a term that Wikipedia tells me derives originally from the rising of Sirius, also called the Dog Star. Oh, the places curiosity (and a good trail of blue links) will take you!

State of things:

- Word on the [concerning fate of saplings in UK woodlands](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/10/britain-ancient-woodlands-failing-regenerate-forests-climate-drought-heat-disease-deer-hope-aoe)—fewer and fewer are making it past five years of age.
- A contemporary account of [the specialization of industrial manufacturing in China](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/07/18/shenzhen), through the eyes of Matt Webb’s journey manufacturing the [Poem/1 clock](https://interconnected.org/home/2024/02/01/kickstarter).

Historical perspectives on multi-member constituencies:

- Philip Salmon at _The History of Parliament_ on [the unexpected consternation the secret ballot caused in multi-member constituencies](https://historyofparliament.com/2025/07/18/the-1872-secret-ballot/).
- [Canada also used to have multi-member constituencies!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_(Canada)#Historical_multi-member_districts) Or, for much more depth, see [James Bowden on the historical origins of Canada’s electoral system](https://parliamentum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bowden-2020-the-origins-of-canadas-electoral-system.pdf), with details on multi-member constituencies at section 3(a), PDF page 6.

Computer stuff:

- Rachel Kroll with an excellent description of [many of the possible intervention points for “I need to make a change to my website”](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2025/05/01/content/).
- After weeks of wrestling with some medium-sized data without any proper analytical tools (and bashing my head against Excel’s various misleadingly-named “Power” features), I wholeheartedly agree that “[We’ve got to stop sending files to each other.](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/weve-got-to-stop-sending-files-to-each-other/) … Data shouldn't live in a file on a laptop. It shouldn't be a single file on a network share. Data is a living beast. Data needs to live in a database - not an Excel file.” (via Simon Willison)

Life reading and listening:

- Two from Paul Wells! First, “[The Summer Reading Episode](https://paulwells.substack.com/p/the-summer-reading-episode)”, a roundtable with a great format: one book you’re reading this summer, and one that sticks with you from summers past. Second, a [Q&A with singer Dan Mangan](https://paulwells.substack.com/p/the-q-and-a-youre-competing-in-the) on becoming known in the age of social media, and [Side Door](https://sidedooraccess.com/home), a business he started with a friend to make it easy to host and play at independent venues (like living rooms, backyards, coffeeshops, and more).
- Collated by Maria Popova at _The Marginalian_, some quotations by Springsteen on his attempts at [a mindful approach to depression](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/07/20/bruce-springsteen-depression/) (a persistent struggle in his life), to name and sit with the feeling.
- An awesome film line-up of “[Compelling Speculations on Human Survival](https://adriennemareebrown.net/2025/07/19/compelling-speculations-on-human-survival/)” curated by adrienne maree brown. (Not just awesome because it includes _Star Trek IV_, “The One with the Whales”, which I was tempted to rewatch this weekend, but also tempted by all the others, but _also_ tempted by _The Bicycle Thieves_ because Bytowne was showing it but neither showtime worked for us.)

All the best for the week ahead!
