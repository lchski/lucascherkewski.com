- difficult decisions
	- Being a public servant, I tend to carry a belief that the state can be a force for good in people’s lives, visibly and invisibly. This belief is coupled with an awareness—a sometimes painful one—that it can also be one of, well, not-good—whether acting in harmful ways or _not acting in the face of harm_
	-	- governments have shifted, in their [toolbox of what governments do](http://www.atlas101.ca/pm/concepts/bardachs-things-governments-do/), away from regulation, subsidies, service provision, rights ([arguably, even, away from information](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-covid-19-data-ba2-variant-sixth-wave/)), to education, in its weakest form (warning and exhortation—but after two years, we’ve become pretty habituated to it)
	- so there isn’t the same social-political framework in which to take decisions—we’re floating a bit more on our own, and “responsibility” for our decisions feels ever more on us, while social norms continue to fluctuate

- vacation, digital cleaning and reading reorder
	- signed out of Twitter
	- archived everything in my catch-all inbox, plan to start unsubscribing as newsletters / adverts come in—and resubscribing to newsletters with Feedbin, for the ones I want to read or have access to
	- doubled down on RSS / controlled Twitter / newsletters—all via Feedbin and NetNewsWire, with bookmarking in Pinboard (via the great Pins app for macOS and iOS)
	- considering downshifting my newspaper subscription for the summer-y months, only getting it once or twice a week, to shift reading from daily news to longer, slower works (thinking of MGG’s “history to start and end each day”)
