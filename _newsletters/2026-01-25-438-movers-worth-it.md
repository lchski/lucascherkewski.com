Yesterday, T and I bought a barely used couch for a great deal—no regrets. We then proceeded to move it ourselves—some regrets. But, it also gave us some laughs and a great story—and a strengthened resolve to hire movers whenever we’ve got big, heavy, bulky moves.

Heading skating shortly with friends, so on to the links!

- I didn’t have a [strong definition of “tenure”](https://higheredstrategy.com/the-three-meanings-of-tenure/) in my head before Alex Usher broke it into three varieties: academic freedom, job protection despite poor performance, and job protection despite institutional financial crisis. As always, strong definitions help us be clearer about what we’re proposing or debating.
- Really enjoyed Lorin Hochstein’s discussion of [how difficult coordination is](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2026/01/24/because-coordination-is-expensive/), and how so many things that are billed as “not work” or “not productive” (meetings, duplicative effort, siloes, etc) are the hard but necessary side effect of coordination work. (I also appreciate the connection to [glue work](https://www.noidea.dog/glue), and the clear position that this work is essential and worth doing well.)
- Mandy Brown with what we ([I, and maybe you](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/78-i-you-we/)) may need this time of year: a gentle nudge in favour of _habits over streaks_, an embrace of doing good things regularly, but not at the expense of rest.

All the best for the week ahead!
