Well, here we are. Just over halfway through 2020.

I’m still having a bit of trouble putting words to paper, so maybe just a few links. 

- [The philanthropy-driven not-for-profit sector allows (usually white) funders to impose their views of what “good” community support looks like.](https://twitter.com/tiffani/status/1279518866008412160)
- [The economy isn’t truly reopened until schools are (safely!) reopened.](https://twitter.com/ldobsonhughes/status/1276684680750907397)
- [LeBreton Flats used to be so, so different, as this high-res aerial photo shows.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chris_in_ottawa/50024432577/in/photostream/)
- [A _Star Trek_ joke about masks? Yes, please!](https://twitter.com/scalzi/status/1278051194632536064) (Sidenote: I rewatched _Star Trek VI: An Undiscovered Country_ on Friday, and am left wondering… did the General Chang character always love Shakespeare, or was that a rewrite after they cast Christopher Plummer for the role?)

Evidently the little time I spent reading online this week was on Twitter… So it goes. But that’s partly because this was a week of reading on paper!

- I finished [Susan Orlean’s _The Library Book_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39507318-the-library-book). I enjoyed the history of the library the most—the attempt to relitigate the accused arsonist’s case wasn’t very gripping. I was distracted by how Orlean repeatedly mentioned her discomfort with people who were less financially stable than she (e.g., people experiencing homelessness).
- I’m diving into [Aldo Leopold’s _A Sand County Almanac_](https://www.aldoleopold.org/about/aldo-leopold/sand-county-almanac/). The brief chapter on the oak tree in February was assigned for a course I once took on environmental history; I’d wanted to read the rest ever since. So far, a nice intellectual ramble.
- On the table to start are [N.K. Jemisin’s _The Fifth Season_](http://nkjemisin.com/books/the-fifth-season/) and [Christopher Skaife’s _The Ravenmaster_](https://ravenmaster.org/#books). The former was recommended by colleagues. The latter was offered by a family friend. Looking forward to both!

That’s all from me for today. All the best for the week ahead!
