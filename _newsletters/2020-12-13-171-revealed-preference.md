We’re living in one of the least interesting timelines, as far as consumer algorithms go. With apologies for the length, allow me to weave a few threads together…

## 1. Revealed preference

Spotify Wrapped, the service’s personalized yearly summary, recently came out. If you’re not familiar, it summarizes your year in music (on Spotify): your top songs, top artists, and so on. This year, it was only available on mobile, which feels like a metaphor—something something consumerism.

My top artists were both unsurprising and puzzling:

1. Bruce Springsteen
2. Billy Joel
3. Pavarotti
4. Elton John
5. Supertramp

None of these are surprising. Springsteen is my top artist every year, I think. But at the same time, they were puzzling: surely male artists don’t dominate my listening, surely I have a bit more genre-istic variety than this?

For example, if I were to list who I thought I listened to the most often, it’d likely include Cher, Tina Turner, the artists behind the _Mamma Mia!_ cast recording, and so on. (Springsteen and Pavarotti would likely still be in that list, but the other three—while great—wouldn’t rank so high.)

Some would argue that this is revealed preference—that despite the values I _think_ I hold, my listening history reveals my _true_ self. But this isn’t the case—because your listening history, depending on how you use Spotify, likely isn’t a collection of intentional choices.

## 2. Choosin’ or cruisin’?

[Courtney made an observation that perfectly captures this distinction](https://twitter.com/sidewalkballet/status/1334146750786002952):

I mostly use Spotify’s “radios” to listen to music: you pick a starting point (a song, an artist, a playlist, whatever) and then The Algorithm™ turns out an endless list of similar tunes. In this system, there are only two intentional actions (two “choosins”, if you will): choosing the starting point, and skipping any songs I don’t like. For the rest, I’m cruisin’, taking what turns up.

The algorithm-driven listening is passive—and I’m okay with that! While I’ll still throw on an album now and again, or put together a few songs in a playlist, the radio experience is one of my favourite ways to listen to music.

But it can also problematize the data that supposedly portrays your music tastes. A few years ago, I heard Simone Rebaudengo speak at CanUX, on training algorithms—he intentionally fed wildly different genres to his Spotify account, to generate more interesting recommendations. If you’ve spent enough time with Spotify, [you may start to feel that its algorithmic tools just churn out the same music again and again—an “algorithmic cul-de-sac”, if you will](https://twitter.com/fishandchipsing/status/1193123764633927680).

That algorithmic cul-de-sac will throw off your listening counts—sure, it’s what you’re listening to, but is it what you’re _deciding_ to listen to? I blame it for my top genre of “mellow gold”. While it’s what the algorithm often converges toward, and is _fine_, it’s not that interesting to me. But I don’t have a good way to push at the algorithm, to retune its inputs.

Perhaps a more relatable version of the problem is if you have a running or exercise playlist. If you’re an avid exerciser, those songs may well dominate your counts, even though that’s not necessarily what you listened to for the sake of listening to music. (I don’t have this problem, but I’m assured by more active friends that it’s a thing.)

When it comes to an end-of-year roundup, then, the simple count of which songs played on my Spotify only tells one version of the story. The version I’m actually interested in is subtler, more nuanced: which artists did I _choose_ to listen to?

## 3. Boring algorithms, boring analysis—brighter futures?

[Spotify Wrapped is an interesting example of consumer-facing data analysis](https://twitter.com/travisgerke/status/1335605202771202052), where the data is presented as a product in and of itself. (This is where my “something something consumerism” comment about Wrapped only being available on mobile comes from—it’s now explicitly built to be shared to social media, to be consumed and circulated as a personal marker.)

But I think it’s a terribly boring example.

We could do so much more. (Saying “we”, I don’t even know who I mean, but stay with me.) What if your Spotify Wrapped weren’t just a simple “count the songs and report back”, but gave you control over the input, so you could create a Wrapped that really felt like _yours_?

Take the example of an exercise playlist. What if you could filter those “listens” out and reconstruct the Wrapped?

Or, what if you could filter out the automatically-suggested songs, only showing your “intentional” Wrapped?

It feels like we’re in one of the least interesting timelines, when it comes to algorithms. They guide much of our digital activity, but we can’t see or tweak their inputs at all, can’t trace or influence their decision-making pathways. 

Though I don’t think it’s meant for situations like this, I wonder whether [the proposed _Consumer Privacy Protection Act_’s provisions on transparency for automated decision-making](https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-11/first-reading) could be used to shed light on these algorithms in the future:

> 63(3): If the organization has used an automated decision system to make a prediction, recommendation or decision about the individual, the organization must, on request by the individual, provide them with an explanation of the prediction, recommendation or decision and of how the personal information that was used to make the prediction, recommendation or decision was obtained.

Given so much of our digital consumer economy is enabled by data, it’d be great if consumers could more explicitly and intentionally engage with that data. Imagine being able to tweak your Twitter (or Facebook, or LinkedIn, _or or or_) timeline, to reweight whatever factors they use. (Or to just turn the thing off and have an actual chronological feed—what a concept!) Of course, part of the service is the magic algorithm—but does it really need to be so secretive?

Anyway, that’s more than enough from me. All the best for the week ahead!
