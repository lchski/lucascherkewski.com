Hello!

It’s been a great week, full of catch-ups and chats and down-time and up-time. With more to come, today and tomorrow! 

Some links for your weekend reading:

- [Hannah Ritchie with an interesting data-informed look at low-emissions behaviour](https://worksinprogress.substack.com/p/notes-on-progress-an-environmentalist)—which often, paradoxically, doesn’t jive with other “morally good” advice like “eat local” ([the emissions costs of transporting most food is so negligible that it doesn’t make a huge impact](https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local); [the food you choose to eat, though, _does_ have significant environmental ramifications](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/food-footprints)). I also enjoyed [Leo Barasi’s nuaunced reply about the environmental costs of plastic vs cotton bags](https://mobile.twitter.com/leobarasi/status/1569410910078357505) (it doesn’t take 20,000 re-uses of the latter to match the emissions cost of a plastic bag, that’s a worst-case scenario). Both, I think, point to the importance (and difficulty!) of understanding the many inputs (including counterintuitive technologies!) to the complex systems that enable our world.
- A [great deep-dive into multi-factor authentication](https://xeiaso.net/blog/push-2fa-considered-harmful), following [the Uber hack](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/16/23356213/uber-hack-teen-slack-google-cloud-credentials-powershell). The level of detail here is _great_, as is the format (a conversation on the internet!).
- [Huge kudos to the folks at the US Library of Congress for the release of the Congress.gov API.](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2022/09/introducing-the-congress-gov-api/) It’s a great, modern, detailed API For those curious, Canada’s equivalent would be the [House of Commons open data initiative](https://www.ourcommons.ca/en/open-data), though it only covers one of the two Houses of Parliament, doesn’t have a great API setup, and is mostly only available in XML (as opposed to JSON).
- [Everest Pipkin shares the experience of watching a million 3-second videos, gathered originally to train AI systems.](https://unthinking.photography/articles/on-lacework) I particularly appreciated Pipkin’s reflection on the work that went into _tagging_ these videos—performed by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers—and how reductive those categories can become. ([via Matt Webb on the “awkward sourcing” of contemporary large language model AIs](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/09/15/libraries))
- Greatly enjoyed the [Fat Gold Guide to Extra Virgin Olive Oil](https://fat.gold/guide/). Olive oil, it’s so great! (I arrived here through a circuitous route—the best of routes on the web—that included [Robin Sloan’s site](https://www.robinsloan.com/). Some other fun pieces from Robin: [programming as home cooking](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/), which resonates really well with my experience; “[Specifying Spring ‘83](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/)”, a draft for a new protocol for the internet; [Robin shares the “assumed audience” for each newsletter](https://www.robinsloan.com/colophon/#assumed-audiences) and, just before that, delightfully explains why he refers to people by first name, something I’ve long grappled with.)

All the best for the week ahead!
