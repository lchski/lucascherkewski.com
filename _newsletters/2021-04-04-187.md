Allo!

We’ve been given the gift of gorgeous weather on this extra long long weekend, and I’m indulging in as much of it as I can. Also I’m hiding from the news, which SUCKS.

Briefly, some links:

- Forgot to share this last week, but [Vass Bednar’s recent “vaccinations as customer acquisition” edition of _regs to riches_ was particularly excellent](https://www.regs2riches.com/p/-vaccinations-as-customer-acquisition). Loblaw is… something to watch.
- [Wil Wheaton shared a memory of William Shatner on the latter’s 90th (!) birthday](https://www.facebook.com/itswilwheaton/posts/3629746393818543), earlier this week. It’s not a great reflection on Shatner—which seems to line up with how most speak of him—but it _is_ a lovely portrait of Gene Roddenberry and the cast and crew of _The Next Generation_. Quietly supportive, as we all ought to be.
- I teared up a bit reading these [sticky notes of gratitude from people who’d just received first doses of COVID-19 vaccinations](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-niagara-vaccination-centre-decorated-with-dizzying-array-of/).
- [DWeb (“distributed web”) is an interesting project (manifesto?) embracing an open, resilient vision of the web.](https://getdweb.net/) Speaking of the web, here’s a niche one: the original _Space Jam_ website, which’d been up at `spacejam.com` since the late 1990s, has been replaced with a fancy new version to promo a new _Space Jam_ movie. But fret not, [the original site is still available, in all its `<table>` glory](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/).

All the best for the week ahead!
