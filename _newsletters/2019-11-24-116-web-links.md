When I want to feel optimistic about technology, I turn to people who help shape the web. (Woo, “web”!) Often these folks have thoughts on blogging, on web publishing, and so forth. They live a philosophy that I can agree with—one of putting your human self forward, sharing kindly, and acting thoughtfully about the future.

So, here’s a list of links that speak to these themes, from some of my favourite writers on the web:

- The tools we use shape our work, today and into the future. As Mandy Brown points out, [tools can also be a statement of values, about what you want to see in technology and what you’d rather avoid](http://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/index-cards/).
- The web has lost a few of its early voices, but their contributions live on. [Ethan Marcotte’s tribute to Dean Allen speaks to the beauty of personal writing, and acknowledges problems with the “old web”.](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/cardigan/) (On a different tack, [Ethan’s recent talk “The World-Wide Work” is worth a read/listen/watch](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-world-wide-work/).)
- We litter content across the web, in the hands of who knows how many service providers. Or, [as Sameer Vasta points out, we can reclaim control of our content](https://www.inthemargins.ca/migrating-to-blot), keeping it in our hands while still sharing it broadly. ([Jeremy Keith, among many others, has also written about this.](https://adactio.com/journal/10675))
- Chronological order dominates the web—but maybe that’s not so great. [Mita Williams (in linking to Amy Hoy) relates personal sites to a librarian’s job of organizing a collection](https://librarian.aedileworks.com/2018/07/07/what-ruined-the-web-was-the-lack-of-good-library-software/), pushing us to wonder whether we’ve gone from less content, better cared for, to more content, less cared for.

That’s all from me this week. Things are a bit zany, hence my “gems from the archive” format. We’ll be back to thinky thoughts in a few weeks :)

All the best for the week ahead!
