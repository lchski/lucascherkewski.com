Hello there!

I’ll try to keep this one short, as I’m soon off to help a friend move and then head home to Waterloo.

Yesterday was a very happy day. One I’d like to remember. It’s a bit of a note to self, but also an update about the kind of things I’m enjoying most these days. Forgive the indulgence.

What was so great about yesterday, and recent days?

- Time with family and friends over great food. Namely, meat and cheese, BBQ, homemade desserts, and ice cream. (Per [last week’s principle](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/100-living-principles/).)
- Fall temperatures with summer sun.
- Staying up too late analyzing datasets for fun.
- Reflecting on [my previous year and my vision for the year ahead](https://yearcompass.com/)—taking stock and correcting course.
- Discussing local government at length with folks who know a lot about it.
- Running walking tours, discussing the history of local buildings, sharing the city I love.
- Meeting friends of friends
