When folks ask me how I feel about my birthday, I sometimes reply, “oh, you know—another day older, closer to the grave”. Which, of course I quote Springsteen, because while we may contain multitudes we also tend to fall back on a few common reference points.

It was a lovely week here in Ottawa—sunny, not too cold, ideal for long rambles. My adventures brought me to Hog’s Back Falls and the skateable extent of the Canal, McKay Lake and the eastern portion of the Ottawa River pathway, and always, always, back to the Rideau River, so often the backbone of my travels in this underrated city.

I relished the chance to walk on my own, the trails mostly empty. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy to socialize with people, and have a pretty full calendar—but sometimes you just need to get away for some solitary wandering, nourishing the soul. (And I was kept good company by so many birds. The cold may drive many birds south, but those that remain are a real treat.)

I also came across some great links!

- For some good web-y thinking, I enjoyed these two pieces:
	- [Jeremy Keith added an “on this day” feature to his website, which he describes as a collection of notes to self.](https://adactio.com/journal/17821)
	- [Hrisoula Gatzogiannis describes 90s _Star Trek_ fan websites, capturing how search engines have upended our experience of the web.](https://ca.startrek.com/news/the-wonderful-world-of-star-trek-on-the-late-90s-web)
- For your daily funny, [check out these Supreme Court of Canada valentines](https://twitter.com/KnottReelLLP/status/1361018605933051909). (Look for a reason to laugh every day!)
- For your daily cute, I’ve enjoyed [Tui De Roy’s photos of penguins](http://penguinworld.net/our-team/photographers/tui-de-roy/). (For more, [open the “Penguins” section in this galley site](http://www.rovingtortoise.com/galleries.html#pu2685).)
- For your daily cool, [learn more about how scientists are proactively developing and testing vaccines against coronaviruses that haven’t even infected humans yet](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/next-pandemic-vaccine-1.5908926).

That’s it from me for today! I’m going to go sit in the sunny front room and idly draw letters. Let the brain wander, when you’re able—embrace boredom, or whatever comes. It’ll do more good than you realize.

All the best for the week ahead!
