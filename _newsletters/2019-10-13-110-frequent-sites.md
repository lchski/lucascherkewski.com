Hello!

Waterloo for the long weekend, [voted yesterday](https://twitter.com/lchski/status/1183062623761420289), and visiting with family. It’s a good time.

I’ve been playing with structured data a lot lately (more than usual, maybe). Sometimes we generate this data intentionally, like assembling a spreadsheet or database. But sometimes it happens accidentally, and we then extract it.

In that spirit, here’s a dataset of sorts, of the suggested URL that comes up when I type a letter in Firefox:

```
letter,url
a,https://app.youneedabudget.com/
b,https://biblio.uottawa.ca/
c,https://calendar.google.com/
d,https://drive.google.com/
e,https://ecustom.ca/
f,https://frankchimero.com/
g,https://www.google.com/
h,https://heinonline-org.proxy.bib.uottawa.ca/
i,
j,https://journals-scholarsportal-info.proxy.bib.uottawa.ca/
k,
l,https://www.linkedin.com/
m,https://mail.google.com/
n,
o,https://open.canada.ca/en
p,https://pinboard.in/
q,
r,https://reservia.viarail.ca/
s,https://scholar.google.com/
t,https://twitter.com/
u,https://uottawa.brightspace.com/
v,
w,https://www.google.com/
x,
y,https://yowcivictech.slack.com/
z,
```

This collection suggests that academic research is a big part of my browsing, along with personal organization apps. Maybe you see trends here that I don’t. I’m glad to see all those sites are HTTPS-enabled.

Yay for a tiny bit of personal transparency! All the best for the week ahead.
