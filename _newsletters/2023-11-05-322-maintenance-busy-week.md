Good morning! 

Yesterday was one of those lovely “maintenance” days. Both in the broadest sense—getting groceries, making sauce for the week ahead, going for nourishing walks in the sun, unpacking and organizing—and the literal sense—I had some new tools to tend to. When cooking an acorn squash, something I’d never done before, I was reminded of Tamar Adler’s excellent advice for testing if a vegetable’s done cooking: when you automatically go for a second bite, it’s done (or, at least, done enough). There are probably some bigger lessons to draw from that—an exercise for the reader.

For any in town attending, I’ll be at [FWD50](https://www.fwd50.com/) this week! Vanessa and I are giving a talk, which should be good fun. If you’re around, reach out or say hi!

- [Public inquiries may have limited impact in the moment, but are key tools to generate evidence for future historians.](https://davidallengreen.com/2023/11/drafts-of-history-how-the-covid-inquiry-like-the-leveson-inquiry-is-securing-evidence-for-historians-that-would-otherwise-be-lost/) Unsurprisingly, I love this. The [Public Order Emergency Commission (“Convoy Inquiry”) generated a trove of insightful documents](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/268-convo-dump/) (not to mention [the detailed testimony into how government works nowadays](https://poec-explorer.labs.lucascherkewski.com/)), to which I hope future historians retain access (and, to dream a little dream, get _more_ access to, that they may one day be declassified / unredacted).
- One of those [life tips that it’s sad to need but also good to read: no phones in the bedroom](https://emilygorcenski.com/post/how-i-read-40-books-and-extinguished-the-world-on-fire/)! As ever, you can also read this as a reminder to have a good think about our relationship to tech!
- [Jack Cheng, on following your interests and how it might relate to career(s) / work—oh, and gardening.](https://www.jackcheng.com/sunday/409-gardening-class-and-career-advice-for-young-and-old/)

To give a sense of how that bench I mentioned the other week has gone over, [Arthur’s been sitting on it regularly](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzD0-ZpAdSa/)—he loves the front door perch.

All the best for the week ahead!
