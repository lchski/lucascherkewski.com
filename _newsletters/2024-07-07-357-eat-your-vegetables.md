Hello!

Writing in the midst of a lovely, family- and friends-filled weekend, including time with R+D beside the Ottawa River and a party for T. Tomorrow’s back to reality, so we’ll enjoy the beauty of the day while we have it.

It’s been a good week for posts discussing best practices for digital government or software teams generally—the kind of good practices, like eating your vegetables, that keep us all in better condition overall:

- [I’ve got a new canon for explaining project vs. product funding, thanks to Jen Pahlka.](https://www.eatingpolicy.com/p/project-vs-product-funding) *(via Sean)* The charts do wonders to point out how different timeframes for comparison shift our understanding of what’s more or less risky. The recent follow-up is good, too, with [some important reminders about the nature of product funding](https://www.eatingpolicy.com/p/what-product-funding-doesnt-mean).
- [Lorin Hochstein’s summary of the CRTC Rogers outage report](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/07/06/quick-takes-on-rogers-network-outage-executive-summary/) brings his delightful perspective of “but here are some nuanced concepts from resilience engineering” to the report.
- [Amanda Clarke and Sean Boots’s paper on federal government IT contracting is out in pre-print.](https://amandaclarke.ca/new-paper-on-federal-government-it-contracting/) That page includes links to previous coverage of the issue to give context—I highly recommend you [read the paper](https://amandaclarke.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-06-28-Breaking-All-the-Rules-Information-Technology-Procurement-in-the-Government-of-Canada-for-distribution.pdf) if you work in the space. Excitingly, [it’s received some media coverage](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/federal-government-it-procurement-study)!

Time to go prep some food! We’ve been getting chard in our [Odd Bunch](https://www.oddbunch.ca/) boxes recently, which I’ve mostly only stir fried in the past. We recently tried [a recipe for chard salad with feta / apple / almonds](https://goddessofgarlic.com/swiss-chard-salad-with-feta-apple-almonds-and-a-lemon-vinaigrette/), and it’s been a hit.

On the subject of vegetables, T showed me [the vegetable orchestra video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=xM1EjIDLMLY) the other day—apparently this did the rounds big time when it came out years ago but I’ve never seen it and it’s so delightful, well worth a few minutes to watch. (Okay, I suppose this isn’t entirely in the theme of “Eat your vegetables!”, but it’s a good use of some vegetables nonetheless!)

All the best for the week ahead!
