Hellooooo! I hope you’re well. The snow on the trees feels properly like winter and the holiday season—hoorah!

This week, I’ve watched opera (it was [Pavarotti week at the Met](https://www.metopera.org/user-information/nightly-met-opera-streams/)), played _Civ VI_ (as mercantilist French nestled unrealistically around Eyjafjallajökull), and eaten several charcuterie boards. Life’s good.

I’ve also encountered great links!

1. This one’s heavy. [_They Were Loved_ shares short, moving obituaries to lives lost in Canada from the pandemic.](https://www.macleans.ca/they-were-loved/)
2. The critical analysis you didn’t know you wanted—[Tressie McMillan Cottom considers the feminism of Hallmark movies](https://tressiemcphd.medium.com/the-feminist-hallmark-movie-universe-bae64a7f2059).
3. Two interesting economic analyses: [immigration has little-to-no effect on the wages of people already in a country](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-immigration-doesnt-reduce-wages); [empty homes taxes do *something* for the housing market, but set expectations low](https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2020/12/07/what-to-expect-from-an-empty-homes-tax/). (I love that *Mountain Doodles* shares their [posts as code _with the data analysis built in_](https://github.com/mountainMath/doodles/blob/master/content/posts/2020-12-07-what-to-expect-from-an-empty-homes-tax.Rmarkdown).)
4. Chris Coyier has it right: [_Feedbin_ plus a feed reader like _NetNewsWire_ is a sublime way to keep up with blogs](https://css-tricks.com/netnewswire-and-feedbin/). Blogs—they’re great!
5. (niche nerdery alert) On _Future Fonts_, you can [buy a typeface in its earliest stages of development, receive free updates, and read the designer’s thought process as they go](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/). The earlier you buy, the cheaper the typeface—a great way to support early career type designers. (I’m noodling on a redesign, so you _know_ I’m poking around here a bunch.)
6. If you haven’t already read the pasta conspiracy story, you should: “[Why is there a Bucatini shortage in America?](https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/12/2020-bucatini-shortage-investigation.html)” (For any in Ottawa who need, I think I have some bucatini in my strategic pasta reserves. Oh yeah, I have those.)

All the best for the week ahead, friend!
