After writing last week’s newsletter, I bundled myself off to the National Gallery to stare at art. This differs from how I normally visit the Gallery, when I glance at art.

This visit was scheduled in my calendar as “Slow art @ NGC”, with a link to [Rob Walker’s “How To Pay Attention”](https://medium.com/re-form/how-to-pay-attention-4751adb53cb6) in the description. In that piece, Walker describes techniques for paying closer, more involved attention to the world around you. Three in particular inspired me:

> 11. Look slowly  
> Robert Irwin, the artist mentioned above, shaped his practice in part by spending insane-sounding amounts of time simply looking — at his own paintings, at rooms, at outdoor settings. …
> 
> 12. Look really, really slowly
> Educator Jennifer L. Roberts [has described](http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/11/the-power-of-patience) an assignment she’s used in art history classes as making students regard a single work for “a painfully long time.” This seems to mean three hours, which does sound like a challenge (although it’s nothing compared to the time Irwin spent studying canvases, en route to concluding, in essence, that canvases were beside the point). …
> 
> 13. Look repeatedly
> In a 2012 essay in *The New York Times*, culture reporter Randy Kennedy [describes](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/arts/design/caravaggio-denial-of-st-peter-met-museum-of-art.html?pagewanted=all) a decade or so of looking, again and again, at Caravaggio’s “The Denial of St. Peter.” The painting hangs in the Met, which Kennedy has occasion to visit often, and taking (yet) another look at this painting has become part of his routine every time.

These principles—paying attention to art, for a long time, over and over—have long been implicit in my visits to the Gallery, but I appreciate how Walker makes them so explicit.

I knew already which piece I’d pay attention to: [W. Blair Bruce’s _The Smiths_](https://www.gallery.ca/collection/artwork/the-smiths) ([image online](https://jamanetwork.com/data/journals/jama/930543/jaj140027fa.png)). It’s caught my eye repeatedly on prior visits for its sense of movement, its fantastical colours, and its impressive size.

As I started looking at it, I heard giggles beside me. A young child, maybe three or four, was running around the pool of water in the adjoining room. As I continued looking at my painting, the child continued their exploration of the pool and the benches surrounding it. At times, I turned to look not at the painting, but at the child, enjoying their sense of wonder. (They were quite content to play with the pond—when it was time for them to go, the child let out some impressive wails.)
