Hello!

Will be brief, today, as we’re enjoying a much needed vacation. The week so far has included sleeping in late, staying up later, enjoying secret pizza and beer by the sea, and catching up with family I haven’t seen in a long time (and introducing them to T). It’s also been fun to see how much my language skills have grown, able to interpret and translate and participate in the various conversations around us. Language is truly a way to unlock other worlds.

Today’s marks the 350th issue hereabouts, but I’ve little in particular to say about that: a common theme is the importance of rest, so I’m going to embrace that and wish you all the best for the week ahead.

Lucas
