Hello!

Ah, September—what a pleasure! Though it’s been a while since the academic year shaped my life, I’m still keenly aware of it—the rhythm of thirds has a better feel than quarters, and the change from the beginning to the end of each set of four months is real, tangible, appreciable. This week is delivering a classic September heat spell, but with luck we’ll soon be snuggled in sweaters.

- I’m a fan of “vibes” posts (call them what you will, but they’re round-ups of what someone did / read / saw / thought / etc over the last week / month / arbitrary period of time). Two I read recently: [Susan Jean Robertson](https://www.susanjeanrobertson.com/notes/august-vibes/) and [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com/2023/09/01/recently).
- Props to Doug Keefe for doing what TBS doesn’t by [making GC rate of pay data publicly available in an open data format](https://github.com/dougkeefe/ps-salary-data) (plus an [API](https://ps-salary-data.vercel.app/)!). (And hat-tip to [Chris Allison](https://github.com/ToferC/payscraper/tree/master) and [Sean Boots](https://github.com/meetingcostcalculator/meeting-cost-calculator-data) for their prior art in this space.)
- This week, I picked up [Jhumpa Lahiri’s _Translating Myself and Others_](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691231167/translating-myself-and-others) from Perfect Books. Essays on reading and writing are a favourite genre of mine, and I really enjoyed [Lahiri’s _In altre parole_ (_In Other Words_)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25614298-in-other-words)—reading and writing takes a whole other feel when moving between languages.
- T and I also picked up [_Gardening Naturally_](https://houseofanansi.com/products/gardening-naturally), a delightful book by [Laurie Perron and  Sarah Quesnel-Langlois of Jungle Fleur](https://www.junglefleur.com/fr)—next year, we’re looking forward to slowly growing (haha) into gardening, and this book has a “just enough info and encouragement” approach that really resonates with us (similar to [_How to Sew Clothes_](https://allwellworkshop.com/how-to-sew-clothes), which we also love).

Posts the next few weeks will be brief, or… not at all!? This newsletter is now six years running (!!), a fact I largely missed last week. The [fifth anniversary issue](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/262-five-years-thank-you/) remains a good signpost to the archive, and [the accompanying data analysis is a bunch of fun](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/hit-miss-fifth-anniversary-analysis/). (Solid Lucas sentence there.) While I don’t feel quite ready to shut it down entirely, issues this summer have been a bit slower to materialize—I’m reading and doing differently these days, in ways that don’t quite lend themselves to what I write here. Which is fine! But that, coupled with a very busy few weeks ahead, has me pondering a pause. We’ll see.

All the best for the week (weeks?) ahead!

Lucas
