- ST: LD
	- "ST with people really excited to be on the ship", definitely like "put a fan on a ship"
	- good references, not overdone
	- very episodic
	- not cinematic, because animated!
- ST, generally
	- scifi channel one series for each day
	- unlike with streaming, can't choose which to watch: just dip into whatever's on, good or bad (gets exposure to the extent of it—I’m okay with rewatching episodes that aren't among the greatest)
- world building
	- reading Broken Earth trilogy was great, but already by end of first book I was annoyed (in a sense)—there were only two books left
	- ST offers hundreds of hours of worldbuilding to dip into
	- same with non-fiction: here's our world, it's built and continues to be rebuilt, dip in at your leisure!
