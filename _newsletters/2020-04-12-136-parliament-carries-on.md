A fine morning to you!

I started my day thinking I’d avoid computers entirely. It’s a long weekend, the perfect time to do so! Then I ~~remembered~~ realized that today’s Sunday (extra long weekends trip up the brain), which meant I needed to touch the computer at least a little. So I thought I’d keep it short, sharing just a few links about Parliament and the recent sittings of the House of Commons and Senate. Then I realized that I had a few thoughts in addition to those links, and here we are, a more or less full newsletter.

Parliament passes legislation and authorizes the government to spend money. Both are necessary these days, as the federal government constructs an immense virus response programme. But running Parliament as usual, with MPs and Senators packed into chairs, with narrow aisles and pages running around, would contravene most public health best practices. So they’ve had to get creative, on two occasions, holding emergency sittings March 24/25 and yesterday, April 11. (There was also some procedural creativity March 13, before Parliament postponed its future sittings.)

Samara published [an excellent review of Parliament’s actions in March](https://www.samaracanada.com/samarablog/blog-post/samara-main-blog/2020/04/02/parliament-under-pressure-evaluating-parliament-s-performance-in-response-to-covid-19), summarizing [a longer piece by Paul Thomas evaluating how Parliament is performing under pressure](https://www.samaracanada.com/democracy-monitor/parliament-under-pressure). Some of the key elements from this evaluation hold for yesterday’s sitting:

- For example, because first reading only happened Saturday morning, [the “draft” bill](https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&billId=10716060) wasn’t publicly available until proceedings were already hurtling along. This limits the ability of both MPs and the public (including researchers, journalists, “stakeholders”, and so on) to critique the legislation—critique which, as we’ve seen, can be instrumental in _improving_ the benefits rolling out.
- C-14 was negotiated outside of public scrutiny. This isn’t different from most bills—back room dealing remains a thing—but in this case we have no evidence at all of what changed, or of who proposed those changes. With other bills, we can at least see what changes from version to version (though, I admit, there can be dealing that happens before first reading to which we’re not privy), while here we just got the final, pre-approved text.

There has also been increased chatter around how Parliament might convene itself virtually. It’s not a new idea. Specific elements, like [electronic voting, have been batted around for decades](https://www.ourcommons.ca/procedure-book-livre/document.aspx?sbdid=37461d8b-10dc-48a4-99a8-8a843ba16e8a&sbpidx=5) (see “The Issue of Electronic Voting” section). [Justifications for electronic voting are popping up](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/march-2020/online-voting-entirely-possible-for-mps-during-times-of-crisis/), suggesting that it be at least one element of Parliament’s procedural response to the virus.

But Parliament isn’t just about the votes. It’s also about debate and the opportunity to ask questions. Some of the most productive venues for those questions, committees, have already gone virtual, with more authorized in [yesterday’s mega motion](https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/house/latest/journals?meetingNumber=33#%20TABLE10718062). One committee is tasked specifically with studying the idea of a virtual Parliament—the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs has never been more exciting! 

Going virtual presents some difficulties. While Canada’s practical needs are similar to any other parliament, we also need (or expect) simultaneous interpretation of proceedings and live streaming with different audio channels (English, French, “floor”). There are also more fundamental questions of [whether a virtual Parliament can accomplish what Parliament is meant to](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-parliament-is-an-essential-service-and-it-cannot-be-done-virtually/), and [whether the nature of Parliament hinders virtualization](https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/blog/seven-reasons-why-parliaments-struggle-digital). But I don’t think we can carry on with in-person sittings at reduced MP count. Recent writings from opposition MPs demonstrate [the importance of opposition in crisis](https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/if-the-coronavirus-emergency-legislation-is-any-indication-parliament-must-remain-open/) and [the danger of allowing party leaders to hand-select who can and cannot participate in House proceedings](https://scottreid.ca/why-i-am-in-the-house-today/).

The [House of Commons administration has been examining virtual sittings](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Newsroom/Articles/COVID-19-SpeakerVitualSittingsResponse-2020-04-07-e.pdf#page=6). Two key assumptions start off their preliminary report, which I find fascinating: “A solution that meets our current business processes and proceedings of the House does not exist; Adapting our processes to existing technology seems to be a more direct route to achieving our goals.” In short—we can’t perfectly virtualize in-person Parliament on a dime; we’ll have to change some of our expectations about how Parliament works to accommodate what’s technically feasible.

And I think that’s okay! This ought to be a time of changing expectations. Trying to fit business-as-usual practices into a changed and changing context is guaranteed to cause pain. Better to assess what’s most important, aim to solve for those needs, and keep moving from there.

And that’s my advice to you, too. Beyond the parliamentary context, focus on doing whatever’s core to you in these extraordinary times. Don’t worry about trying to carry on as before—just try to carry on as you can, today and tomorrow and so on. I’m rooting for you. All the best for the week ahead.
