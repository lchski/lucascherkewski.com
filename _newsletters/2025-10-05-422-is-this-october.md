There’s a day each year, though you never know the day, when you shut the windows for the last time, letting the sash settle into the frame for its long winter sleep. Thankfully, we haven’t reached that day yet, but I feel it coming soon. Until then, though, both A—though currently in my lap—and I are glad for continued opportunities to sniff through open windows. (Or, y’know, to go through open doors.)

- I shared it a few weeks back, but want to re-up [Krista Tippett’s conversation with Sylvia Boorstein](https://onbeing.org/programs/sylvia-boorstein-what-we-nurture-2022/)—there’s a shared period of reflection midway through that’s well worth a listen (and participation).
- Turns out cheap rechargeable batteries (not the little AA ones, the ones you find in appliances, e-bikes, and so on) from knock-off brands are [far more likely to be fire risks](https://www.theverge.com/news/784966/lumafield-x-ray-ct-scan-lithium-ion-battery-risks-manufacturing-defect) than those from conventional brand names.
- Lorin Hochstein weaving together some different, but related, quotes and reflections on [how people process information](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/09/28/a-statistic-is-as-a-statistic-does/) (and what’s left out when we entrust this entirely to statistical or computational methods).
- A delightful [journey into a weather forecasting service’s API](https://entropicthoughts.com/ecmwf-open-data-howto).
- Some of Rach Smith’s [three strategies for surviving a day](https://rachsmith.com/strategies/) ring true for me, but the real kicker is the note-to-self closing paragraph.
- What Václav Havel (born today, many moons ago!) taught about [living in reality](https://bijansabet.com/2025/10/05/when-we-stop-pretending/).
- It’s rare to post something time-sensitive, but Craig Mod is currently running a pop-up newsletter, [_(the entire walk is) Between Two Mountains_](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/216/). The first few issues have been delightful—I highly recommend signing up to receive the rest. (If you miss it, perhaps you’d be enticed to support Craig’s work through his [SPECIAL PROJECTS](https://craigmod.com/membership/) membership program, which includes access to the archives of pop-up newsletters.)

Two neat local items:

- The neighbourhood paper featured the [“Chosen Grandma” program](https://chosengrandma.ca/), connecting senior women with families looking for extra support for their children. What a lovely concept.
- [REEL Politics](https://reelpolitics.ca/) is a new film series for folks interested in politics and film. Proceeds go to supporting a number of good initiatives related to politics and journalism. I’m aiming to make [Thursday’s screening of _All the President’s Men_](https://www.bytowne.ca/movies/reel-politics-all-the-presidents-men-1976/)—maybe see you there?

To leave you, the closing words from [“I Am Once Again Sitting by a River” by Winston Hearn](https://www.winstonhearn.com/wrote/2025/i-am-once-again-sitting-by-a-river/):

> it seems to understand  
> that which believes itself to be in control  
> has not yet been flooded  
> with the lessons of time

All the best for the week ahead!
