Hello!

It was a week filled with speaking, writing, and all the thinking that goes along with that. My brain is properly melted, but some nourishing walks are setting it right. It’s strange to look outside, see sunlight, and know that it’ll be there for two hours more. [Hooray for daylight!](https://sboots.ca/2021/03/10/yukon-stopped-doing-seasonal-time-changes-and-its-really-great/) (You share a link, a friend writes about it, you write about their writing… [writing on the web is fantastic](https://www.inthemargins.ca/inbox-newsletters).)

On Thursday, I had the pleasure to speak with the Toronto Data Workshop (TDW). [I first attended TDW in May of last year](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/142-to-your-taste/), thanks to its then newly online format. It’s a great group—supportive and engaged, with attendees from a wide array of backgrounds. (And hi to any folks newly subscribed to this newsletter via TDW! My ramblings here vary widely—it won’t always be about data or data analysis, but it’s great to have you nonetheless!)

I spoke about some of the ways I’ve used data in my policy work at the Canadian Digital Service. I focused on a few projects—none of them particularly grandiose or involved—which took text data, usually published in an unstructured format, and cleaned them up to make them easier to analyse. These projects reflect [my broader interest in facilitating access](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/125-facilitating-access/)—how might we make it easier for others to do their work, with data or otherwise?

Many thanks to the organizers at TDW for having me.

So, on the seeming inevitability of a third wave here in Ontario.

Public health comms are walking a careful line between “vaccines are here! 😁” and “variants (of concern) are here! 😬” (Or, delightfully, [building joke upon joke](https://twitter.com/ottawahealth/status/1370373335138373637) while still [sharing great public health advice](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/good-job-bruce-the-guy-behind-north-americas-top-public-health-twitter-account/).) Government response seems… well, apparently this is the right time to open things up and encourage mobility, if you infer from the government’s lockdown policy.

And while cases seem “stable” (stable around a thousand a day which is… still a lot), looking under the surface reveals two different stories: [the variants of concern are racing upward, while the virus in its earlier forms is in decline](https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/ontario-dashboard/) (see the “Estimated Incidence per 100,000 Inhabitants per Week in Ontario” chart, midway down the page).

We’re close! Very close. Just as the signs of spring have many of us in a good mood, so too may news around vaccinations. I mean, [Yo-Yo Ma performed during his 15-minute post-vaccination waiting period](https://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/local/after-receiving-second-dose-yo-yo-ma-transforms-waiting-period-into-performance-at-pittsfield-vax/article_72e90bf8-843d-11eb-99e0-bb989805e596.html)—there’s a lot of good energy tied to vaccinations, and rightly so!

But I’d just gently, lovingly, encourage sustaining your caution for a while longer. And to [upgrade your masks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mapcgmkIzq4lva2xEIfNp7hgUlCyrpRWmUsF4dB62Z8/edit), if you can. Just because governments are opening things back up doesn’t mean we need stream back into the world. (I know it can be hard to keep on as we have been—if you’d like to chat, I’m always up for a phone call or such.) Keep rolling, my friends.

With that, I’m off to enjoy a windy, sunny evening. All the best for the week ahead!
