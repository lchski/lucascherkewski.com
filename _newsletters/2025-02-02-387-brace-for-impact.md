Yesterday, after riding the new O-Train lines 2 and 4 with friends in the morning, I spent a sunny afternoon playing _Age of Empires 2_ while T knit. I lost, but saw it coming, and was okay with it. But even in losing, I had a tiny contingent of folks building a new little town; always some hope somewhere, even amidst much gloom.

Sigh. We shall see what the weeks, months, and years ahead bring.

Some weeks I find myself writing something or agreeing with someone I don’t normally expect to—you can guess which of the items below fits that bill:

- Pumped to see [Erin Kissane writing about Ursula Franklin](https://www.wrecka.ge/ursulas-list/). Franklin, one of my two favourite Ursulas, has so much to teach us.
- Matt Webb on [using quantified self apps like Strava when you're not as young as you used to be](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/01/30/) (or as young as the app makers were when _they_ made it). (See also, e.g., the lack of sick or resting days in “keep the streak!” type fitness apps. After a few years of use, I can recommend [Gentler Streak](https://gentler.app/) as a truly gentler alternative.)
- Some [convincing arguments from Danielle Smith against using oil as a bargaining chip](https://paulwells.substack.com/p/when-america-attacks) in this trade war, pointing to how much the rest of Canada imports energy from the US and how ill-equipped we are to change that.
- As government draws up new policy and gears up existing systems to address the economic woes to come, we’d do well to listen to [Jennifer Robson on a smarter use of data within existing systems](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/february-2025/pandemic-lessons-trump-tariffs/) (plus where we ought to focus on collecting better data).
- David Moscrop on [nationalism in troubled times](https://www.davidmoscrop.com/p/confessions-of-a-reluctant-nationalist).
- Bourbon, my preferred American import, fails the [“English or French” tariffs test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYUI4hu950w) due to delightful historical quirks of the French legacy in what’s now America.

All the best for the week ahead.
