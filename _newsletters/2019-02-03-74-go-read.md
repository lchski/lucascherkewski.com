A very happy February to you!

I had several ideas for this week’s newsletter, but then I slept in this morning (gloriously) and now find myself wanting to get to the art gallery before freezing rain hits. I’m also brained out after writing [a scraper for Ontario’s database of historical plaques](https://github.com/lchski/oht-plaques).

So, I leave you some links!

* Inspiring me this morning is [Austin Kleon’s piece on Ursula K. Le Guin’s writing routine](https://austinkleon.com/2019/01/23/the-ideal-routine/). Two things Kleon loves that I do, too: the dedicated space for both domestic work and reading. My afternoon today will include both of those.
* Charlotte Whitton, [the first woman to be mayor of a Canadian city](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/first-female-mayor-was-also-ottawas-most-colourful) (Ottawa), was a total badass.
* [The Canadiana Collection is now freely available to the public.](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/news/news-article/over-60-million-pages-of-digitized-canadian-heritage-documents-now-accessible/) I know it sounds dusty, but I assure you it’s fun to peruse. Consider, for example, the [Canadian Railway and Steamboat Guide from 1858](http://online.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.8_04331_41/2?r=0&s=1), or [original copies of William Lyon Mackenzie King’s speeches](http://heritage.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.lac_reel_h3064/27?r=0&s=1). There’s so much in here, from newspapers to government records to books. And it’s all free!

I also want to gift you this poem, “Today”, from the late Mary Oliver, because it is delightful:

> Today is a day of  
> dark clouds and slow rain.  
> The little blades of corn  
> are so happy.

May you be like those little blades of corn, happy even during days of dark clouds and slow rain. All the best for the week ahead!

Lucas
