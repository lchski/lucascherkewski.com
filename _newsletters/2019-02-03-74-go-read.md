A very happy February to you!

I had several ideas for this week’s newsletter, but then I slept in this morning (gloriously) and now find myself wanting to get out and about before the forecasted freezing rain makes such activities ever more dangerous. I’m also a little tuckered out after many hours Friday and yesterday writing [some functions that scrape the database of Ontario’s historical plaques](https://github.com/lchski/oht-plaques). (Google Cloud is really cool.)

So, I leave you with—surprise surprise—some links!

* Somewhat inspiring me this morning, [Austin Kleon’s piece on Ursula K. Le Guin’s writing routine](https://austinkleon.com/2019/01/23/the-ideal-routine/) (with references to those of other writers.) Two things Kleon loves that I do, too: the acknowledgement of domestic work, and the dedicated time for reading. My afternoon today will include both of those.
* Charlotte Whitton, [the first woman to be mayor of a Canadian city](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/first-female-mayor-was-also-ottawas-most-colourful) (Ottawa), was a total badass.
* [The Canadiana Collection is now freely available to the public.](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/news/news-article/over-60-million-pages-of-digitized-canadian-heritage-documents-now-accessible/) This collection has proven invaluable in my academic work to date, and it’s also just fun to peruse. Consider, for example, the [Canadian Railway and Steamboat Guide from 1858](http://online.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.8_04331_41/2?r=0&s=1), or [original copies of William Lyon Mackenzie King’s speeches](http://heritage.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.lac_reel_h3064/27?r=0&s=1). There’s so much in here, from newspapers to government records to books. And it’s all free!

I also want to leave you with this poem, “Today”, from the late Mary Oliver, because it is delightful:

> Today is a day of  
> dark clouds and slow rain.  
> The little blades of corn  
> are so happy.

May you be like that little blade of corn, happy even during days of dark clouds and slow rain. All the best for the week ahead!
