Hi there. Weird times. Just a week or so from holidays, and it’s decidedly Christmas-y out, but I haven’t felt hugely in the spirit. T and I were discussing classic Christmas movies the other day—it may be time to dig one up.

While it was an excellent week at work, and a great day with friends yesterday, I’m left feeling pretty down this evening. Partly, I think, from some poor time management today—fell too deep down a few rabbitholes that left me scrambling to do some other things. Partly, no doubt, from poor expectations: hoping for too much from the hours in a day. And, partly, from some tricky family stuff unfolding. ‘Tis the season.

More cheerily, can I share my latest book haul with you? Yesterday, T and I went to Perfect Books. (It was very busy—when someone asked Jim, the owner, if it was because of the tax break, he replied, “Could be. But it’s also the second last Saturday before Christmas. Today, you get all the organized people. Next week, whew.”) The haul:

- [_Loving Corrections_](https://adriennemareebrown.net/book/7450/) by adrienne maree brown. The title alone conveys so much, but the linked page is a good summary. I recognized some of the ideas from [brown’s appearance on _On Being_ this summer](https://onbeing.org/programs/adrienne-maree-brown-on-radical-imagination-and-moving-towards-life/)—looking forward to sitting with them more.
- _A Swim in a Pond in the Rain_, a “workbook” of Russian short stories by George Saunders, coupling seven stories with exercises for thinking through writing. 

On to some links:

- [A thorough dissection of “debanking”](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/debanking-and-debunking/), laying out various understandings of the term and responding to current (crypto-adjacent) claims being made about it. Includes some CanCon! (About the convoy! ConCanCon? CanConCon?)
- [On working to become ambidextrous.](https://duncanellinwood.substack.com/p/ambidextrousity) (This piece discusses it in baking and woodworking, but it inspired me to reflect on the ways we can consciously _work to become_ ambidextrous.)
- Exploring [the desk of a literature professor in the mid-80s](https://blog.ayjay.org/intellectual-furnishings/). Led me to this [brilliant essay on “intellectual furnishings”](https://medium.com/@shannonmattern/intellectual-furnishings-e2076cf5f2de)—if it feels a bit too theory-laden, jump ahead to the section on bookcases (lots of Manguel connections went off in my head).
- [A touching remembrance by Sameer for his grandmother.](https://www.inthemargins.ca/maa-a-remembrance) (May we all aspire to be written of with such love.)

Writing this hasn’t made me feel _better_, but it feels normal and familiar, and for that I’m grateful. _Deep breath._ All the best for the week ahead.

P.S. The title is because: a) it’s a solid winter night; b) I listened to a bunch of Harry Chapin and Gordon Lightfoot today. (Plus some Bruce, of course.) Can recommend.
