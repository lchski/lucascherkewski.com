Hello from a mostly-not-jet-lagged Lucas! It was quite a time adjusting to Ontario, uh, time, but I far preferred being awake early to always wanting to sleep in.

There’ll be more on Japan another time, but [Craig Mod’s latest _Ridgeline_ captured well some of our experiences in Tokyo](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/171/): sweltering in the late summer heat, exploring Yanaka and nearby neighbourhoods, and marvelling at all that can be found between two stops on a train line.

For this week, though, some good links:

- Erin Kissane has written [an in-depth series on Meta / Facebook’s role in Myanmar and the genocide of the Rohingya people](https://erinkissane.com/meta-meta). I particularly appreciate the piece I link there, which explains Erin’s methodology and writing conventions, important when dealing with such a traumatic topic from another part of the world.
- I’m glad [a deputy minister spoke, frankly and on the record, about the changes they’re bringing to their organization](https://paulwells.substack.com/p/the-repair-job-at-immigration).
- [No More Noise Toronto](https://www.nomorenoisetoronto.com/index.html) is advancing an important issue that I wish cities would pay better attention to: urban noise as a health issue (found via Code for Canada’s newsletter).
- I can definitely see [nostalgia for a particular experience of suburbia as a kind of political ideology](https://www.readtheline.ca/p/john-michael-mcgrath-why-carve-up).
- [Dan Bouk’s “Making Up Numbers” captures well a whole field of study I find fascinating: the social underpinnings of data.](https://www.shroudedincloaksofboringness.com/2023/09/20/makingupnumbers.html)
- There should be a spot held in this newsletter for a [Maria Popova / Ursula K. Le Guin link every week, as with this one on “Change, Menopause as Rebirth, and the Civilizational Value of Elders”](https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/09/30/ursula-k-le-guin-menopause/).

To close, I leave you with [Sameer’s note on the change from summer to fall](https://www.inthemargins.ca/the-change-of-the-seasons), full of many more thoughts and links worth your time. All the best for the week ahead!

Lucas
