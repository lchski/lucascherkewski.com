It’s “cold” but not really cold today. After a few months of winter, the body adjusts—what feels unacceptably frigid in early fall becomes a pleasant winter day. I’m in the front room, sun streaming in and window open wide. My feet are chilled but my core is warm, and I’m enjoying the contrast.

[About this time last year, I saw the signs of spring.](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/129-spring-feelings-readings/) We’re not quite there, yet it feels close. A run of zero-ish weather will start to melt the snow, yielding weeks of slush and puddles. I overlook this part of winter, the inevitable counterpoint to frigid days and accumulating snow, the cycle nearing its yearly completion.

I reminded myself earlier of [what I find relaxing](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/therapeutic-things/), casting for something to ground me. (I’m okay, on the whole—don’t fret!) While my list of therapeutic things does help, I think it’s missing a preface on context. Remember: when you’re a bit down, don’t carry on with an empty stomach, make sure you’re drinking water, and so on, if you can help it. Therapeutic activities need a healthy host to do their best work.

A few links for you:

- I rarely listen to podcasts. This one was worth it. I’ve long followed both Roxane Gay and Debbie Millman in their respective fields, and [was thrilled when I first read about their engagement](https://www.autostraddle.com/roxane-gay-and-debbie-millman-are-girlfriends-thats-big-news/). Well, [Brené Brown recently interviewed the two together, and it’s a lovely conversation](https://brenebrown.com/podcast/brene-with-roxane-gay-and-debbie-millman-on-love-life-and-the-pursuit-of-creative-space/). (With transcript, if that’s your jam!)
- I’m not sure how I encountered it, but [this Black Ottawa Scene obituary of Desmond Doran is a beautiful portrait of a community figure](http://blackottawascene.com/in-memory-of-desmond-doran/). Such a full life.
- [This history of the Toronto Public Library, framed by some key buildings, celebrates the library in its varied forms.](http://activehistory.ca/2020/09/a-history-of-the-toronto-public-library-in-four-buildings/)

All the best for the week ahead.
