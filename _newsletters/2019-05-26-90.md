Hullo there!

(Apologies for any mixed up tenses. I’m writing this Saturday afternoon. Delayed-newsletter-sending gods permitting, you’ll get this some time Sunday morning.)

I’m out doing a half marathon with my mom right now. (Walking.) She’s here with my family. Also in town are other walkers from my parents’ weekly walking group—all familiar faces from my visits home. It’s Race Weekend in Ottawa—there are thousands participating in this weekend’s various races.

Until a few weeks ago, I intended to walk this race on my own. I saw the three and a half hour walk as a challenge of my physical and mental endurance. Maybe this impulse lingered from my needs when I agreed to walk the race, back in the winter.

Since then, my plan changed. Two weeks ago, my walking buddy and I walked 18 km at our race pace. I didn’t doubt my physical endurance. I’ve also spent plenty enough time in my own head to know that three and a half hours isn’t trouble, either. I decided, then, to walk it alongside my mom.

She and I are similar in many respects. We both keep piles of book nearby. We both want to directly know and work with those we serve. We both value and make time for family and friends. (This last one especially is a value shared by both my parents.) I look forward to the chance to spend a few hours with her, walking and talking.

More abstractly, I look forward to walking this race _together_, accomplishing it not as individuals but as a partnership. When I worked freelance, I always preferred jobs where I worked with another person—they offered a sounding board.

Even more abstractly, I’m glad that we’re walking as part of a larger community, my parents’ walking group. This small community of folks is a favourite of mine—knowing that we’re all participating together warms my heart. 

I’ll admit, the larger scale of the Race Weekend—the thousands of participants, the crowds of people, the cheering, and so on—doesn’t appeal to me. It’s something I’m steeling myself for.
