Hi folks!

Hope you’re all doing well. Two interesting links, as I slowly get back into a groove:

- [Land trusts as a growing player in housing](https://thelocal.to/neighbourhood-land-trust-affordable-housing-toronto/) (along with [all the pieces in The Local’s Rent Series](https://thelocal.to/issue-18/))
- [Erin Kissane has started up a new one of those ol’ internet sites, with a characteristically thoughtful, thought-provoking opening post](https://erinkissane.com/matches-pebbles-hair-salt)

I’ve got some nice time with friends planned for the days ahead, followed by some calm days at home with T and A. The past few days of summery weather have been nice, but also a reminder to revel in the joys of spring while they’re here—in refreshing rains, rapid regrowth, and the buds of new flowers. I’m grateful to everyone who’s reached out since my note last week, and look forward to sharing this spring weather with you soon. 

All the best for the week ahead!

Lucas
