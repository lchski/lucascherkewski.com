I came home to a surprise last week.

* lateral economic move (higher speed same price because dropped a feature), justifiable by my dad
* from playing Runescape on dial-up to 5 mbps
* asking Charlotte to not stream Netflix while I was on a screen share/video call for usability testing for a client
* still think 5 mbps down is a decent, quite acceptable speed (HD streams werenâ€™t as doable, but if you sit further back SD becomes HD)
* job interview discussing broadband access and the economic opportunity of faster connections
* library lending wifi tethers to take home
