Hello!

Another weekend spent checking out cool places and visiting with friends. I heard a mockingbird this morning, which was super exciting. More on that another time, though—it’s time soon to head back out!

In the meantime, three links I found interesting in the last bit:

- [Mandy Brown, responding to the hype around AI, by unpacking the idea of “intelligence”.](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/smoke-screen) As ever, a concise, provocative piece, that returns you (or, me, at least) to consider some core values.
- [Interesting account—and argument for the merit—of trying to archive “householders” from Members of Parliament](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/march-2023/mp-newsletters-householders/), the newsletters MPs can send using parliamentary (public) funds.
- [Inflation is causing ice cream producers to reduce the size of their containers, which triggers taxation, as they’re now considered “single serving”.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-shrinkflation-ice-cream-tax/) Gotta love (“love”) unintended consequences.

All the best for the week ahead!
