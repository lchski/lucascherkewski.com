Hello,

- difference between this and a normal newsletter
- walking group: have mentioned it (link), but not discussed its characters; until now
- about S
	- news clippings
	- lab technician at UW?
	- lovable crank
	- particular circumstances (not how, but context—stress of the situation)
- how to grieve?
	- walk
	- M*A*S*H “Goodbye, Farewell, Amen”
	- write
	- go to 
- [draw from notebook]
- for the others we've lost
	- Courtney Brousseau (https://twitter.com/pahlkadot/status/1257349473426120706 https://twitter.com/KyleBJorrey/status/1256834310738345984)
	- for the so many others
- what’re we left with?
	- last time I saw S, probably a summer walk last year—no news clipping I can think of, but definitely discussed the news. remember specifically S asking about how he could buy a train ticket without having a computer, without wanting to use the kiosks (security worries)—an inspiration at the time, and again now, to think about how we can serve each other without privileging the online (digital, not online)
	- from S specifically, a prompt to think of others—to look at something (the news, some construction, whatever), realize “oh, so-and-so would love this”, then to share it with them
	- a reminder of the fragility, fleetingness, beauty of life
	- thanks for indulging this remembrance. I don’t know how much will be written about S, so I wanted to contribute something and know that some folks had spent time learning about him and what we might learn from him. I’ll go back to the regular from next week—but maybe you can think of the links and commentary I share as little clippings, as if I’d encountered them and thought of you, through this newsletter. stay safe and stay lovely, my friends.
