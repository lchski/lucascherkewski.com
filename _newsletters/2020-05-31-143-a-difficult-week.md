Friends, it’s been a week.

Personally, professionally, and, well, for the world at large, but especially here in North America, this has been a week of long days and long nights.

I don’t know how to properly do justice to what’s gone on this past week, here or in the US. My heart aches, and it’s difficult to know what to say without adding noise.

So I’ll do my best to let others speak, to direct you to better words:

- First, lists of anti-racism/things to read/how you can help for the present moment (both via coworkers, thank you!). [One specifically for non-Black folks to support Black communities in Canada](https://tinyurl.com/supportBlackcommunitiesCanada) ([direct document link if that one doesn’t work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvVbCG-7ubJDBISQGy02fQjFmUm2gWHJ08x1nDwoTcc/edit)). [Another with a more American focus](https://bit.ly/ANTIRACISMRESOURCES) ([direct document link if that one doesn’t work](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1BRlF2_zhNe86SGgHa6-VlBO-QgirITwCTugSfKie5Fs/mobilebasic)).
- Next, [a thoughtful list of sci-fi reading recommendations for these days, from Cyd Harrell](https://twitter.com/cydharrell/status/1266411925841174530) (via a friend, thanks!): “non-escapist science-fiction recommendations, many of them by writers of color … books that for one reason or another help me think about our current situation & the future.”
- Finally, [a short Twitter thread by Elamin Abdelmahmoud on how much Canadian cities spend on policing versus other (arguably more essential) services, like housing and public transportation](https://twitter.com/elamin88/status/1266724692137738241). (Note: I tried to replicate the method using [Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing Financial Information Return data](https://efis.fma.csc.gov.on.ca/fir/Welcome.htm) and found Toronto spending 9.5% of expenses on police, third after “conventional transit” at 23.1% and “general assistance” at 16.7%, but this is probably due to a different methodology. I stumbled upon this as [I tried to calculate Ottawa’s percentage spent on police](https://github.com/lchski/ongov-fir-analysis/blob/master/analysis/misc.R): it’s 9.3%, the second highest after “conventional transit” at 15.1%. Calculating the breakdown for Waterloo—my hometown—is a bit trickier, as costs are split between the City and the Region, which provides policing services for several lower-tier municipalities.)

Not much from me this week, and that’s okay—I encourage you to dig into some of the links in the resources I provided, to reflect on your situation and that of those around you, with a particular eye to the effects of racism and how you might carry out anti-racist behaviours. All the best for the week ahead.
