Hi!

Exciting things afoot, but I’m low on energy and brainspace this afternoon. I don’t have anything in particular to say or share this week, but am pleased to report that moving (inside or outside), tending to little bits of earth (in my case, watering plants), and [“Grandparent hobbies”](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/welcome-to-garden-study) continue to be great ways to fill you up. In case you didn’t follow that link, here’s how Anne Helen Petersen defines Grandparent hobbies:

> No one told me that aging would include gradual and then overwhelming obsession with Grandparent hobbies. What is a Grandparent hobby? Broadly conceived: Woodworking. Needlework. Specialty baking. Unscheduled comfy chair napping. Puzzles. Scheduled walks. “Visiting.” Golfing poorly. Block printing. Bridge or canasta or Mahjong. Smoking in the backyard. Word games. “Tinkering.” Fiber Arts. Driving people to medical appointments. Birding. Listening to baseball on the radio. Reading large-print history books.

> A Grandparent hobby doesn’t have to have done by *your* Grandparent. It just has to be something that you do without mind towards optimization. 

Here’s to Grandparent hobbies. All the best for the week ahead!
