Hello!

T and I spent the day in Montreal with family—a last minute decision, but a nice change of scenery (even if much of the scenery was obscured by blowing snow). It’s been a lovely weekend, spent happily with people I love very much. (Montreal friends, I’ll be sure to come for longer next time, and give you a heads-up!)

To the links!

- [Anne Helen Petersen paints a compelling portrait of the “layoff brain”, a generational psyche borne of constant precarity.](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/layoff-brain) I’ve been thinking about this essay all week. (Including, for _reasons_ the section on “Consultant Layoff Brain” and the excerpt about McKinsey. What a broken world.)
- [A story of a week spent with Ursula K. Le Guin—on meeting our heroes (gods?), writing, and facing it all with good humour.](https://granta.com/her-left-hand-the-darkness/) May we all have something of Le Guin’s clever grace. (via Mita Williams)
- [Vass Bednar’s most recent newsletter does some characteristically clever policy thinking with Canada’s anti-spam and (federal) privacy law](https://www.regs2riches.com/p/casls-in-the-sky), imagining versions of control over technology well beyond our current paltry offering. What I perhaps appreciated most, the imagining aside, was Bednar’s pointing out the potential already inherent in the legislation, missed due to lack of enforcement efforts.
- [Tom Critchlow points out a web publishing gap: it’s relatively easy to get a webpage online; it’s relatively hard to get a small database online](https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/27/small-databases/), particularly one that people can contribute to collaboratively. (via Simon Willison)
- [The South Pole is a constant process of snow management, to the point where decades-old buildings, though still fully functional, are buried under many feet of snow.](https://brr.fyi/posts/south-pole-topography)

All the best for the week ahead!
