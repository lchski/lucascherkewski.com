- length of things hard to grasp (numeracy??)
	- e.g., little blue container of Oral-B floss has 9.2m of floss in it—roughly a two-story building (with high storeys—also, what a strange word)
	- length of intestines, too!?
- bigness of other numbers, like number of possible chess games > atoms in the known universe (comparisons like these always mindboggle)

- got flu shot Monday. five minutes (maybe fewer!) from walking in door to getting the shot in my arm. wow!
	- 15 minutes I spent waiting afterwards, sitting in waiting area with others (plenty of space, good ventilation)
	- had planned to listen to a podcast (which I rarely do, so I was looking forward to the opportunity)
	- but took my headphones out almost immediately: instead, revelled in sitting near other people, nobody “doing” anything, overhearing murmured conversations and just general being. it's been so long since I've been able to do that!! like sitting in a lunch room, or at a library, or at a train station. wow.
	- wondered, too, how it'll feel to get that _other_ eventual shot in the arm (or two). capacity, etc—I’m staying cautiously optimistic. also vaccine efficacy is _given current conditions_ i.e. masks etc (well, kinda)
