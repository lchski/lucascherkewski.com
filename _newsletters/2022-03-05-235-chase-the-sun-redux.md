tough week
- and I was barely reading the news
- feels weird to have a tough week when the world is on fire (literally, metaphorically, literally again) [link to climate change, Ukraine war generally, nuclear plant] [find a link from Sean's set to share]
	- but also important to remember how our context, aka the world being on fire, affects how we process and respond to things happening in our personal lives! so things that'd be manageable during a “normal” week (but what's normal anymore) will be that much harder, maybe to the point of being overwhelming, during a hard week


- reminded of the importance of a few things:
	- chasing the sun (Solstice app!)—the days are _noticeably_ longer, which I love (and soon the time change, because yes we still do such archaic things, and yes the jet lag will suck, but the sun will persist so nicely into the evening! https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/179-chase-the-sun/
	- dealing with problems during daylight—both literally and metaphorically, it’s hard to see optimistic paths through a problem when you're surrounded by darkness. (Austin Kleon, "Don't think too much about your life after dinnertime." / "Deal with problems in daylight." https://austinkleon.com/2018/08/27/a-very-simple-rule/) – for the metaphorical side of things, see the point above re context of the world [TODO and or reorder to reflect]
	- it’s better to go through things _together_ than alone. even though that can be hard! it’s easy to run and hide, particularly for folks for whom solitude is a bit of a default state, or for whom individualism trumps all (I fall into the former, and am bombarded constantly by a culture of the latter). grateful to those around me—to T, to family, to friends, to coworkers, to strangers, who’ve shown kindness and care and concern and support, without question or condition.

- notion of ambiguity, from Mandy Brown’s latest newsletter (itself a response to Ursula K. Le Guin’s _The Dispossessed_) https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/disambiguation
	- “ambiguity typically arises from the intersections between people—it is rarely a solitary condition”
	- “But much of the conventional advice about managing ambiguity focuses on what one person can do alone—not on how people can come together to explore or investigate what each of them sees. Naked individualism—that is, the ideology that places the individual always and forever *above* their community rather than *within* it—invites us to challenge ambiguity by declaiming our own view, instead of listening closely to others. This turns a state of ambiguity into conflict, likely to be resolved along the existing lines of power. But in that way, the ambiguity isn’t addressed so much as it is masked or obfuscated. The ambiguity—like the wall—is still there, even after everyone looks away.”
	- reminded also to [reflect on “What thoughts am I thinking with?”](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/case-for-rereading)
- _Black Futures_ book, its structure and “related” entries at beginning of each

- so anyway, I’m walking and talking and trying to meditate and stretch and remember that my body has to be well for my mind to deal with difficult moments in a healthy way
	- enjoying the work of others who share my deeply nerdy interests https://parliamentum.org/2022/02/26/review-of-the-prime-ministers-constitution/
	- reminding myself of how exciting the work I do (or can do) can be https://publicpolicydesign.blog.gov.uk/2022/02/24/making-a-service-map-in-a-policy-department/
	- appreciating folks on the internet who reflect on its longevity (or not) https://adactio.com/journal/18862
	- holding on to signs of spring https://twitter.com/laura_shantz/status/1497979971196833793
	- taking comfort and delight in others’ uncomplicated joy https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/im-common-muck-spent-150-23194880
	- and writing, writing, always writing
