Hi!

Happy Sunday.

I stepped back a few years this week, working remotely instead of from an office. I appreciated the flexibility—it allowed me to visit some family and friends in Waterloo, while also going to a few appointments—but was reminded of some of the ways in which working remotely takes a toll.

The biggest difference I noticed when I began working in an office was that I was always around people. It sounds obvious, but being in the presence of others changes the workday dynamic considerably.

* lack of interaction with coworkers
* less of the randomness of work: more opportunity to focus, but also more of a feeling of obligation to work (don't get pulled into random conversations etc)
* work spread throughout the day
