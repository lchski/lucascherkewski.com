In the first issue of this newsletter, I described [the process of unboxing and reshelving my books after moving to a new apartment](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/1-earthworming/#the-bright-side-of-moving-reshelving).

As the long duration of our mostly-at-home life set in, back in late March, I decided to buy some new bookshelves. I had about twelve stacks of unshelved books around my room—getting them onto shelves would reduce the clutter, making it a more calming space. But it was also to assert some control.

Maintaining a library is, in some way, an act of control. Shelving books—for me—is like creating a new world, configuring it according to my tastes and sensibilities of the day. It’s a reflection of the self, as I wrote in that first newsletter:

> I believe strongly that a personal library is a reflection of its owner. What exactly it reflects is known only to the person who assembles it, but looking at a person’s private library is enlightening. My library indicates my past, present, and (desired) future selves. Alberto Manguel writes that “we enjoy dreaming up a library that reflects every one of our interests and every one of our foibles—a library that, in its variety and complexity, fully reflects the reader we are.” Such a library is “an assembly of titles that, practically and symbolically, serves [to define us].” (These are from “The Library as Identity” in *The Library at Night*. If you stay with my writings, you’ll hear much more about Manguel.) Mandy Brown, another of my favourite writers, [puts in words](http://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/ways-of-reading/) my own thoughts on the personal library:
>
> > The best library contains both books you have read, and books you have not. The latter should grow in proportion as the library expands. A working library is as much a place for the possible as it is a record of the past.
>
> A place for the possible, indeed.

I came to grapple with this notion of the library as identity very directly during this reorganization. See, I now have three bookshelves. In my bedroom, there’s space for one. The other two are in the front room, a space shared with my housemate. This presented me a puzzle: which books should be in the bedroom versus the front room?

The bedroom books would be closer at hand during the moodier moments, suggesting that I should keep the most personal books there. But they’d also be hidden from the “public” view of any friends coming to visit—if a library is identity, does that identity need to be expressed, to be visible, to be communicated?

Perhaps. All the same, I decided it was more important to keep my most moving, inspiring, personal books close at hand, in this inner library. When I’m feeling a little down, feeling I’ve lost some of the idealism or aspirations that used to drive me, I look around at those books and remember that there are many ways to make an impact, to leave a mark. (Plus, there won’t be anybody coming to visit for at least a while….)

I also took the chance to incorporate some little jokes into the arrangements of the outer library. For example, my small section of Italian stories and novels sit beside Pierre Bayard’s _How to Talk About Places You’ve Never Been: On the Importance of Armchair Travel_. While I’ve been to Italy, the little “armchair travel” piece gives me a chuckle. (As for _How to Talk About Places You’ve Never Been_, well, [I’ve never read it, which would suit Bayard just fine](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/how-to-talk-about-books-you-havent-read/).)

As I’ve mentioned my reorganization, many have asked me about how the books are ordered. While there’s some large-scale objective ordering, it’s largely a subjective one. Even at that large scale, the fiction/non-fiction divide, the rules aren’t perfect: that Italian section, for example, combines fiction, memoir, and history into one little group. I pile books around me and keep assembling new piles based on books that I think speak to one another, books that should spend time shoulder to shoulder. And it never ends—maintaining a library is like cultivating a garden, expressing and re-expressing one’s identity through careful attention and consideration. It’s a beautiful endeavour, a life’s work.

And with that reflection, I leave you for today. The long weekend has some potential in it yet. Maybe I’ll actually get to reading some of those books :) All the best for the week ahead!
