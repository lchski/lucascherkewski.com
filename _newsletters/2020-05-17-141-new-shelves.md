In the first issue of this newsletter, I described the process of unboxing and reshelving my books, after moving to a new apartment.

As the long duration of our mostly-at-home life set in, back in late March, I decided to buy some new bookshelves. I had about twelve stacks of unshelved books around my room—getting them onto shelves would reduce the clutter, making it a more calming space. But it was also to assert some control.

Maintaining a library is, in some way, an act of control. Shelving books—for me—is like creating a new world, configuring it according to my tastes and sensibilities of the day. 

- personal bookshelf vs "outside"/other room bookshelves
- leaving space for roommate's books?
