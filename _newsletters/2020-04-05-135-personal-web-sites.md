Good morning folks! It’s a drizzly Sunday morning—I’m soaking up the quiet and [watching _Urbanized_](https://www.ohyouprettythings.com/free).

Last week, [Ethan Marcotte wrote about redesigning his website](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/). The process gave him an outlet for the mounting stress of the world around him:

> While things were changing, I kept working. After a few weeks tinkering with this redesign, I realized I wasn’t working on a website, not really: it was a worry stone.

It’s a good reminder of a few things: the calm from quietly making; the need for worry stones when things are, well, as they are; and the potential of having your own corner of the web, a personal site.

I’ve long been a fan of personal sites. At the end of 2013, [Frank Chimero resurrected the idea of “homesteading” as a response to a siloed, fragmented web](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/homesteading-2014/), where our content is scattered across so many social media sites. Personal sites can be our homes on the internet:

The web has great potential. Indeed, [the internet and the web are key to responding to the current health crisis](https://twitter.com/jensimmons/status/1246559684670164993). But the most enduring potential, for me, is realized through personal sites.

There are quite a few personal sites I look to as inspiration ([many are in my site’s blogroll](https://lucascherkewski.com/rolls/)). Here are a few of them, with little annotations for why I like them:

- [Mandy Brown](https://aworkinglibrary.com/) shares some of the best reading recommendations I’ve found, plus essays and reading notes that always push me to reflect on what I read.
- [Sameer Vasta](https://www.inthemargins.ca/) documents his extensive newsletter archive, plus reading notes and more. (For example, “[Me, now.](https://www.inthemargins.ca/now)”)
- [Tatiana Mac](https://tatianamac.com/)’s site design has big, bold colours and other details that make me want to view source to understand _how_ the site works.
- [Waldo Jaquith](https://waldo.jaquith.org/) has maintained [20+ years of archived blog posts](https://waldo.jaquith.org/page/562/).
- [Jessica Hische](http://jessicahische.is/)’s site has a consistent current of playfulness. (For example, the URL scheme: [jessicahische.is/talkingtype](http://jessicahische.is/talkingtype) for the transcript of a talk on typography.)
- [Karolina Szczur](https://thefox.is/) has a clean, fast design (maybe no surprise, given that Karolina is product design lead for [Calibre](https://twitter.com/calibreapp)) with [great write-ups like year-in-book-reviews](https://thefox.is/writing/2020/books-in-review). 
- [Tim Wu](http://www.timwu.org/) has a bunch of quirky sections, including [a touching page on his favourite teachers](http://www.timwu.org/favoriteteachers.html).
- [Beck Tench](https://www.becktench.com/) speaks to different parts of her life in a consistent and compelling way. (I love the “influences” list in each section, for example.)

Evidently it’s not _just_ the design of personal sites that compels me, but also the totally open range of what to put on them. They’re places to put, well, whatever _you_ want, in whatever format you like—not constrained by what a social media platform permits or incentivizes, with only your own ideas as a limit.

Anyhow, do you have a personal site? I’d be curious to see it, if you do. (For now, I don’t think I’ll carry on the shareback at the end of the email.) All the best for the week ahead!
