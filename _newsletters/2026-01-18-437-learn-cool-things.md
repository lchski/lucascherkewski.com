Hullo!

I spent much of the day at [Ottawa City Woodshop](https://ottawacitywoodshop.com/), finishing a side table build. They moved to a new space late last year, and it’s spectacular—there’s a separate, upstairs room for hand tool work, with wooden floors, high ceilings, and big windows. I’m not sure which of those I love most. (While light is important, never underestimate the feeling of a good floor!)

Anyway. It was great to be back, but I’m wiped from a full day of woodworking and a few nights of poor sleep. Straight to the links, then:

- I love Winnie Lim’s reflection on [getting better at the skill of learning](https://winnielim.org/journal/why-i-had-to-be-a-runner-before-i-could-learn-the-piano/), and how physical stamina is also important for enabling our brains. Relatedly, on learning, Nicky Case’s “[How To Remember Anything Forever-ish](https://ncase.me/remember/)” remains a fundamental piece for me—spaced repetition is such fun (lol, nerd), I genuinely enjoy opening [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and working through the day’s stack.[^anki] Anyway, here’s to a love of learning.
- Anil Dash wrote an epic [history and cultural analysis of Markdown](https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/09/how-markdown-took-over-the-world/). Even if you don’t know what Markdown is (it’s a set of text conventions for formatting writing), you can intuit its meaning just by reading it—brilliant.
- Jeremy Keith’s telling of [the three-day workweek](https://adactio.com/journal/22351) sounds very appealing.
- Ben Werdmuller imagines the “[Zurich Protocol](https://werd.io/the-zurich-protocol/)”, an anti-censorship mechanism for global newsrooms. And he does it by writing a story—an under appreciated format for sharing new ideas.
- Christoffer Stjernlöf (`kqr`) writes in praise of [keeping a slide rule in your kitchen](https://entropicthoughts.com/kitchen-slide-rule), which: a) blew my mind; b) sent me down a delightful slide rule rabbit hole (I can see it being quite useful for furniture design and woodworking, with its ability to easily work proportions). That brought me to [_Eric's Slide Rule Site_](https://www.sliderule.ca/) (a `.ca` domain, go [Eric Marcotte](https://comicphilosophy.com/index.php/about-us/)!), one of those delightful early-web sites that’s been maintained essentially untouched.
- Epic video showing [how a (quality) book is printed and bound](https://blog.lostartpress.com/2017/02/17/how-a-lost-art-press-book-is-made/). Those guillotine cutters are awesome / terrifying.
- Oh, [a 7,000-year-old wall buried underwater](https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/submarine-wall/) off the coast of France? Hell yeah. 
- If you’re looking for a book recommendation in these slow, quiet winter months, I’ll re-up my recommendation for [Sam Wilket’s newsletter _Forests in Her Mind_](https://www.samwilket.com/newsletter/). Sam recommends _Dawn_, by Octavia E. Butler, in her latest issue, which I picked up last weekend and am looking forward to enjoying.

All the best for the week ahead!

[^anki]: Part of my love for Anki, I think, is that it gives you the lightest elements of gamification (here’s a queue of tasks to work through, you can feel yourself getting better at them as they come and go!) without the worst parts of it. Crucially: Anki has no social features, and there’s no “streak” to speak of; if you skip a day, it presents you your modified stack without judgement, and on you go.
