Hi there!

This weekend is normally one of my favourites in Ottawa: Doors Open, when numerous interesting organizations, big and small, open their doors to provide public access to rarely seen spaces.

[As I wrote two years ago, it’s a great initiative](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/91-doors-open/): we have so many interesting spaces—many of them paid for with public funds—that are accessible to only a select few. Would that it were possible to see them more often; alas, we settle for the morsels we get.

This year, you can [check out the 2021 Doors Open Ottawa virtual tours](https://app06.ottawa.ca/cgi-bin/doors/2021.pl?lang=en).

Favourites from past years include:

- [Bytown Museum](https://bytownmuseum.com/virtual-tour/)
- [Canada Council Art Bank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PO6VFerXLY)
- [National Arts Centre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0ouoqejDE4)

Also of note (to some) is the construction update on the [Centre Block of Parliament Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpPkF933hZE) (gets good around 2:00).

It’s awfully hot out today, so maybe enjoy some touring from your (hopefully comfortable) home. All the best for the week ahead!

Lucas
