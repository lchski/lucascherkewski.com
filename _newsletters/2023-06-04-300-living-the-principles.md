Hi!

A very happy Sunday to you. We’ve had a whirlwind few days, but in a way that feels as relaxing as it’s been full: a woodworking course yesterday morning (such fun!), checking out some Doors Open spots today (the greenhouse at Rideau Hall, excellent as always), visiting with friends in Strathcona park (another spot that’s consistently great, especially with friends).

As I look up at “Issue #300”, I realize happily that those activities exemplify [some of the principles I shared 200 issues ago](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/100-living-principles/), when this newsletter switched from the double to single digits. Thank you, as ever, for being along for this ride.

Briefly, some links, as I’m itching to do more things off-screen, before a week with loads of staring at screens:

- One of those recurring “yes, THAT!” pieces of life advice is that you are who you surround yourself with. [Liz Danzico shares that back with a delightful visual of crayons, encouraging “combining favorites to make new life happinesses”.](https://bobulate.com/2023/06/crayon-collisions/)
- Some of these concepts are too formal tech for me to fully grasp, but I really enjoyed this off-the-wall [post by Xe Iaso on implementing, uh, IPv6 networking via Amazon S3](https://xeiaso.net/blog/anything-message-queue).
- For George Michael fans, [the lick from “Careless Whisper” on 100 (non-saxophone) instruments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ZgM3p_Scnh0). (via Jason Kottke)

All the best for the week ahead!

Lucas
