Hello!

I travelled briefly back to Waterloo this weekend, for my nonno’s birthday. Time with family has kept me happily occupied—I’ll keep today’s letter short. Just some links:

* [Jianying Zha describes her dissident brother’s various experiences with China’s state security apparatus.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/chinas-bizarre-program-to-keep-activists-in-check) As she explains, ‘Since 2011, China’s annual spending on domestic _weiwen_, or “stability maintenance,” has, according to some reports, surpassed defense spending.’ China is a major global influence today; it’ll be ever more so tomorrow. This piece brings you into a tiny, revealing corner of the country’s activities.
* [Machine learning (jk, standard statistics) helps to investigate the identity of an anonymous Twitter account, @horse_js.](https://whoishorsejs.com) It’s a nice, accessible walkthrough of a data science project. (In another “reveal the author” project, [Peter McCormick names the probable author of the Supreme Court of Canada’s “by the Court” decision in _Comeau_, based on textual analysis](https://doubleaspect.blog/2018/05/01/la-cour-cest-qui/).)

All the best for the week ahead!

Lucas
