Hello!

It’s a wonderfully sunny day here—it’s amazing how much sunshine and brightness can cheer your heart and soul.

Back in January, I learned that [you can only have 500 tabs open  at a time in Safari on iOS](https://twitter.com/lchski/status/1341012197149913090).

I know, I know—500 tabs!? Most of those I’ve read to some extent; they don’t crush my consciousness, they’re not [unanswered letters guilting me into paralysis](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2014/jettison-the-rest/). Rather, they’re sitting there waiting for me to file them away.

I’m a big fan of bookmarking. [Pinboard is my tool of choice.](https://pinboard.in/) I have about 4,200 links saved in there. For most, I’ll add a few tags (so I can find them later), and maybe write a brief summary or quote some key passages. Many of these newsletters have been fuelled by my Pinboard archive—I’ll look at links from the last few weeks, curating a collection to share with you.

But at some point in the last year, my standard approach to saving links from iOS broke. The app I used wouldn’t cooperate consistently, so I just gave up on saving them. But I didn’t want to lose that history of what I’d read or found interesting, so I kept the tabs open.

Recently, though, I discovered [iOS’s Shortcuts feature](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios). It’s a way to automate certain actions, like setting a timer or logging data. It allows you to chain those actions, and to feed them input of various sorts. For example, you could have a “laundry timer” shortcut that asks whether it’s a long-duration or short-duration load, and sets the timer length accordingly. (A contrived example, maybe, but stay with me.)

For those who write code, this might sound familiar. It’s programming in a nutshell: actions done in sequence according to user input. What’s neat about Shortcuts is it opens actions on your phone, across its different apps (both the built-in ones and those from third parties), to programming. [You can do some very impressive work with Shortcuts.](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/hey-siri-whats-my-blood-sugar-learning-to-code-with-apples-iphone-shortcuts) (And [if you invest in a bunch of accessories… well, there’s even more, but we won’t get into that](https://airtable.com/shrhYQ0UVa0UBavpU/tblsM2nRGxtYcxKF1?backgroundColor=blue&viewControls=on).)

Tools like these seem like great avenues to introduce people to programming concepts, like conditionals (if this happens, then do that) and variables (take what the person typed in, we’ll use that in the next step, maybe transforming it a bit along the way). Their potential stems from their fusion of programming concepts with _a context and actions that matter to people_—their phone, and whatever it can do. It can be compelling to learn a concept like programming in service of making something you do every day a bit easier, a bit less repetitive.

This also has me thinking about the notion of [“Yes Code”, as a response to “no code” tools: that we should make it easier to learn to code, even in small ways, because of the advantages it unlocks](https://medium.com/@anildash/no-code-is-great-but-heres-why-we-need-yes-code-c5f6fd615a51). It’s exciting to see [Airtable’s continued success, as it allows you to build automations (programming apps, essentially!) around very rich datasets](https://airtable.com/), with just a little bit of coding—whether coding explicitly or through sequenced blocks.

Writing this reminds me how much I miss mentoring at Ladies Learning Code (now [Canada Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/)) events, the real satisfaction that comes from learning to solve small problems well. The world is cool!

All the best for the week ahead. Seek out sunshine when you can!
