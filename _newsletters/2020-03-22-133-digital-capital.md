I’m sitting in my front room, watching _Helvetica_. It’s free until Tuesday, you can [stream it from Gary Hustwit’s site](https://www.ohyouprettythings.com/free).

I’ve been working at my desk, watching operas. There’s a new one every night, you can [stream it from the Met](https://www.metopera.org/).

I’ve been reading in my bed, listening to concert recordings. A whole back catalogue is available for a month, you can [stream it from the Berliner Philharmoniker](https://www.digitalconcerthall.com/en/home).

There are also free yoga sessions, free live concerts, free this, free that—it’s all free, in these first days of restricted freedom.
