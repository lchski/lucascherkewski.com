How do we organize to take decisions and act on the results? Thinking here of processes that often—but not always—produce some _thing_ as a result.

In the area I work, two approaches that come to mind are project and product management. Sometimes it’s not altogether clear how they differ. The terms are so similar, it can be hard for folks familiar with one to understand the other.

When explaining product management, some of my go-to clarifications emphasize its ongoing nature, prioritizing people over processes, and constantly delivering value. (Unsurprisingly, [these echo core principles from the Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/). They also reflect a broader “delivery” ethos, but we’ll leave that aside for today.)

But maybe it’s useful to ground this comparison in more powerful metaphors. In _The Real World of Technology_, Ursula Franklin describes two models of action, production and growth. I’ll quote her next, but there’s more nuance than I can capture here. (I put up [more excerpts if you have the time](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/franklin-production-growth/).)

> Growth occurs; it is not made. Within a growth model, all that human intervention can do is to discover the best conditions for growth and then try to meet them. (20)

> A production model is different in kind. Here things are not grown but made, and made under conditions that are, at least in principle, entirely controllable. If in practice such control is not complete or completely successful, then there is an assumption, implicit in the model itself, that improvements in knowledge, design, and organization can occur so that all essential parameters will become controllable. Production, then, is predictable, while growth is not. There is something comforting in a production model—everything seems in hand, nothing is left to chance—while growth is always chancy. (20–21)

> The real world of technology seems to involve an inherent trust in machines and devices (“production is under control”) and a basic apprehension of people (“growth is chancy, one can never be sure of the outcomes”). (25)

These models, to me, capture the differences between project and product management. One adopts a production model—like an industrial assembly line. The other embodies a growth model—learning (I think) from agrarian cultivation.

_The production model._ Project management borrows from the industrial assembly line. You move from start to finish—at the end, you’re done work, and the thing is built. If issues occur with the result, you re-apply the process.

_The growth model._ Product management, on the other hand, borrows from agrarian cultivation (thinking here of the tradition described by Wendell Berry, Aldo Leopold, and so on). Work follows a regular rhythm, continuously progressing toward “done” before starting again—delivering value all along the way. You deal with issues constantly, as they come up, though they’re usually at a smaller scale. And you keep at it as long as the problem exists, solving it in ever better ways.

(An aside: it’s telling that, when enterprise-y tools fail, people develop “hacky” workarounds. This is the growth model responding to the standardized output of the production process—the output doesn’t necessarily account for context, so people hack it to suit their life.)

(Should also note a few caveats. My description of project management is based on my observations of how it plays out in practice. Also, product management isn’t inherently as I describe—rather this reflects a particular flavour that I admire.)

Under whatever label they happen, I think our processes can learn much from the growth model Franklin describes. Consider especially its relationship to planning:

> Women in particular have developed such schemes over the centuries—arrangements that are not a surrender to randomness, but an allotment of time and resources based on situational judgements. ... What makes them so different is that holistic strategies are, more often than not, intended to minimize disaster rather than to maximize gain. (80)

Our processes ought to emphasize ongoing attention and care, recognize and respect the importance of all people involved, and attend carefully to ever-changing context. We risk fooling ourselves if we treat any of these—time, people, and context—as external to our work. They _are_ the work—of decision and action, at least.

Apologies that we’re running a bit longer than usual, but I hope it’s a useful reflection. Where might we incorporate the principles of growth—and, given our current context, sustainable growth—into our approach? It’s on my mind, and would love to hear whether it’s on yours. All the best for the week ahead.
