Folks! The evenings are cool and the mornings crisp! Fall is coming! This is not a drill!!

Very full days behind and ahead of us—with some exciting news to share in weeks ahead—so will just share some links, while hoping you’re getting chances to enjoy beautiful weather and quiet days.

- Noticed over the last few weeks two “lite” versions of news sites: [CBC Lite](https://www.cbc.ca/lite/news?sort=latest) and [NPR’s text-only version](https://text.npr.org/). They’re lightweight designs with minimal data usage (only loading images when you choose to, for example), with few if any ads—as a result, they’re blazing fast to load and interact with. Everything a website should be.
- On [what makes a healthy place to live and be](https://werd.io/2023/homesick).
- [Lorin Hochstein’s writing](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/) often shifts my view of the world slightly but profoundly (so, too, with [Marianne Bellotti](https://bellmar.medium.com/)). Two posts from Lorin that kept chipping away at that view: “[Why LFI \[Learning from Incidents\] is a tough sell](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2023/08/20/why-lfi-is-a-tough-sell/)” and “[Normal incidents](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2023/08/20/normal-incidents/)”.
- [When archivists smell vinegar, it’s time to act.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vinegar-syndrome-acetate-film-1.6939032)

All the best for the week ahead!
