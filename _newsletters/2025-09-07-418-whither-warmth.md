Today‚Äôs title is not about the rapid fading of the summer‚Äôs heat‚Äîthough thank goodness for that‚Äîbut instead about the unpredictable ways climate change will continue to destabilize our world. While we often associate climate change with global warming (and we‚Äôll certainly have, on average, hotter summers), the massively complex system that is our earth will sometimes do just the opposite.

Consider the [Gulf Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream).

Intuitively, moving north from the equator, temperatures get colder. (At the northernmost distances, there‚Äôs ice year round, so I think our intuition is good on this one!) But it‚Äôs not just distance north that affects temperature: proximity to the coast, and to which coast in particular, can make an area much warmer than it‚Äôd otherwise be.

Take, for example, northern areas of the UK or Europe. They‚Äôre roughly on par, in terms of latitude, with northern Ontario, yet the winters tend to be much milder. This is thanks to a variety of circulatory systems, including the relatively well-known Gulf Stream, but also lesser-known ones, like the [Atlantic meridional overturning circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation) (AMOC).

Anyhow, updated modelling suggests that [the AMOC could be at a crucial tipping point in the coming decades](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/28/collapse-critical-atlantic-current-amoc-no-longer-low-likelihood-study) (if that), at which point it could slow or even collapse. This‚Äôd lead to even more sea level rise, but also to colder, wetter winters‚Äîwith potential for massive social changes as a result, as seen during the [Little Ice Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age). (Whether our response will be more in the vein of [frost fairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames_frost_fairs) or the [March Across the Belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_Across_the_Belts), well, that‚Äôs still TBD.)

If the prospect of colder winters is too frightful, rest assured, we‚Äôll also have warmer summers. üòé

- We were at the National Arts Centre Orchestra (NACO) performance earlier in the year when it was announced that Alexander Shelley would step down as music director. While I‚Äôve never known a NACO without Shelley‚Äôs influence, it‚Äôs clear the energy and enthusiasm he brings to the task. I‚Äôm heartened by [Paul Wells‚Äôs reflection on the appointment of John Storg√•rds to the post](https://paulwells.substack.com/p/welcome-jontte), and look forward to what future years bring. (In the meantime, I‚Äôm ever grateful for the NACO‚Äôs [archive of excellently produced performance recordings](https://nac-cna.ca/en/video/series/naco-live-concerts-ocna).)
- Now, from Winnipeg, [data-informed reporting on changes to the city‚Äôs transit system](https://thenarwhal.ca/winnipeg-transit-overhaul-analysis/)? Why yes, please. (via SB)
- One of the oldest posts on this version of my blog is about [colour names and ‚Äúthe folly of subjective references‚Äù](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/named-colours/). Well, some folks have undertaken an interesting project to give [‚Äúdefinitive‚Äù colour values for over 30,000 different colour names](https://meodai.github.io/color-names/). Impressively, this only covers 0.18% of the ~16 million colours that can be expressed in the 256-bit RGB colour space. David Aerne built a  tool to [visualize this distribution of named colours](https://codepen.io/meodai/full/zdgXJj/), and you can toggle between different models (RGB, HCL, etc) to see the different ‚Äúshapes‚Äù these distributions take.

Mm, that‚Äôs enough inside time for now‚Äîsunny skies are beckoning me for a bike ride! All the best for the week ahead!
