Two things happen when I return home to Waterloo.

1. I track my time much less rigorously.
2. Of the time I do track, much of it is filled by long stretches of social time with family.

And I’m okay with both of those.

When I’m off in Ottawa, I feel some need to account for my time, as if I want to ensure that my independent time is well spent. (Admittedly, I rarely review my time tracking data to see how I measured up—I think the incentivizing happens through the act of measurement itself.)

When I’m with family, though, I wonder if I have some higher confidence that it’s time well spent, time that I don’t really need to account for.

I realize it’s not always the case that folks feel this way about their family. For what it’s worth, I tend to extend similar thinking to my chosen family, to the friends with whom I spend my time—I’m not too worried about an accurate accounting, because I know it’s all worthwhile.

To close, I’d just like to share the [latest edition of Sameer’s newsletter, “Finding the things that you love”](https://www.inthemargins.ca/finding-things-to-love). It’s short, sweet, and impactful—as always.

Here’s to happy days, and time well spent. All the best for the week ahead!
