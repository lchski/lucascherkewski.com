Hello!

Bit of an off day energy-wise—trying to fit in too much, not doing a great job cutting myself slack when I can’t fit all that, and wallowing over all of it. I know I should heed advice I shared just last week, [Mandy Brown’s “Energy makes time”](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/energy-makes-time/)—and yet, and yet, and yet.

Some recent brightspots included sunny afternoons in parks with T, quality time with family and friends visiting town (S and C yesterday, along with S and V!), morning bike rides, and plenty of summer ice cream. Quality go-tos, regardless of whatever else is going on.

I’ve also been enjoying _Star Trek: Strange New Worlds_. I’m sure others have put this better, but it’s a good example of how Trek could become / is becoming an archetypal universe, where different performers can play Kirk, or Uhura, or Spock, or so on, each bringing new dimensions to a familiar character—and, perhaps, helping us [re-nuance misunderstandings of characters we think we know through and through](http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/columns/freshly-rememberd-kirk-drift/). The [musical episode](https://www.polygon.com/23817437/star-trek-musical-strange-new-worlds-episode-snw) was also a delight, and I look forward to continued Trek oddness. (Also to _Women at Warp_’s review of said musical episode, [once the writers / actors strike concludes](https://www.womenatwarp.com/women-at-warp-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-and-the-wga/).)

So anyhow—time to put some energy into making good of today’s time. All the best for the week ahead!
