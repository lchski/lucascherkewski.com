Arthur’s on the couch beside me, dreaming about whatever cats dream about; my family are arrayed through various rooms of the apartment; and T’s sleeping off a night shift. I am, in other words, surrounded by loved ones—and happy for it.

I’m pretty tired, so straight into the links we go:

- Maria Popova always weaves together her reading with deft and grace—including a [recent piece on suicide and living, centred around a Roxane Gay reading of a Gwendolyn Brooks poem](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/07/22/to-the-young-who-want-to-die-gwendolyn-brooks/).
- [Simon Willison recently shared highlights from twenty years of blogging.](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/12/twenty-years/) I’ll always cheer for folks celebrating their blog—blogging can be such a nourishing experience.
- [Cory Doctorow recommends _A Half-Built Garden_ by Ruthanna Emrys](https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/26/aislands/#dead-ringers) and I just want to run out and read this book.
- In [last week’s issue](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/255-welcome-party-pal/), I linked to [Michael’s piece on “Government from home”](https://medium.com/@supergovernance/government-from-home-576e673b8a03). This week, [Steph Percival followed with a call for a fairer, flexible future of work, grounded in empathy and ethical experimentation](https://medium.com/@stephpercivalwashere/the-future-of-work-a-shared-future-72ea194a82fb), and [Sean contributed his own perspective on the power dynamics inherent in the current approach toward “hybrid” work](https://sboots.ca/2022/07/30/worth-reading-government-from-home-a-shared-future-of-work/).
- [Mandy Brown reflects on the idea of practice as a way to ponder and _shape_ the future, drawing on Octavia Butler and adrienne maree brown.](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/practice-the-future) Practice is one of those delightfully malleable words—a verb and noun, both of which have a a number of adjacent but distinct definitions, definitions that can prompt a different way of approaching a situation—and this piece captures well its potential.

All the best for the week ahead!
