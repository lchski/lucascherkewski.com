This week’s update is a heavy one. Our cat Arthur has been at the animal hospital since early yesterday, and will be there until at least tomorrow. He had a urinary blockage, which can quickly go south for cats, particularly males.

In some ways, it happened in the best possible way—despite not showing any signs previously, Arthur chose his annual vet visit on Friday afternoon to show that he was having trouble urinating (by trying to pee in the sink!) and was in discomfort. It’s very on-brand for him, to be so chaotic yet intelligent.

Now, we’re waiting. He’s getting really good care, and is doing better, but it’s a risk-laden situation. We’re hopeful, but also having a whole range of conversations—you never know how these things go. The house feels emptier without him, and there have been a lot of tears. It sucks.

For those of you who’ve met Arthur, it’ll be of little surprise that he’s his usual social self, even while in an unfamiliar environment. While our other cat, Pema, tried to stick her head in a dark corner and hide when we took her to the vet, Arthur’s impulse the entire time at the animal hospital has been to say hi and explore, even while sedated. (Sometimes to his own detriment: he’s been so active at times that he managed to pull his IV line—classic.) Apparently, he’s taken to resting one paw outside the bars of his little space, like Steve McQueen or Paul Newman in a 60s prison film.

I wasn’t planning to write much about this, was just going to do a “things are heavy, hopefully back in better shape next week” newsletter, but T reminded me of the power of community, that suffering in solitary silence (definitely my default!) isn’t the only way. Friends have been a source of comfort and cheer these past few days, and writing this brings its own solace. Thank you for reading.

And, of course, this personal drama occurs in the wings of a global tragedy. It wouldn’t help Arthur’s case, but one does wonder how much conflict could be avoided if men would just man up and go to therapy.

Despite all this, there’ve been moments of lightness this past week, including:

- A strawberry party with T, G, T, and D (with strawberries featured in _every_ dish, not just dessert!), including my first ever chocolate-covered strawberries.
- Enjoying cookies from our neighbour in our driveway, after sharing some pear pie with her.
- Making my first curls and shavings on a spoon. (Finally, a kind of woodworking I can easily do outside, and take with me!)

Anyhow—we’re off to see the little guy. For him, for you, and for any other loved ones in your life, I wish all the best for the week ahead.
