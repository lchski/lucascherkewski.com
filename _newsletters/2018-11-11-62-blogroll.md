Hia!

I’ve been redesigning my personal site, and with it I’ve been considering what I admire about the web. One of those things has always been blogging—something I’m trying to do more frequently, with some success.

In that spirit, I’ve been preparing a blogroll to share on my site. For me, a blogroll is the list of sites I turn to when wanting something to read online. Here, in no particular order, are some of the people whose sites I’ll list on mine:

* [Mandy Brown](http://aworkinglibrary.com/)
* [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/)
* [Anil Dash](https://anildash.com/)
* [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/)
* [Erika Hall](https://medium.com/@mulegirl)
* [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/)
* [Dan Mall](http://danmall.me/)
* [Liz Danzico](http://bobulate.com/)
* [Maria Popova](https://www.brainpickings.org/)
* [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/)
* [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/)
* [Sarah Drasner](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/)
* [Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/)
* [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/)
* [Khoi Vinh](https://www.subtraction.com/)
* [Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org/)
* [Tina Essmaker](https://medium.com/@tinaessmaker)
* [Jessica Hische](http://jessicahische.is/)
* [Mark Boulton](https://markboulton.co.uk/)
* [Philippe Lagassé](https://lagassep.com/)
* [Sameer Vasta](https://www.inthemargins.ca/)

There’s a pretty heavy “people who make the web” tilt to these names, which should come as no surprise, and, though I haven’t tallied it up, there’s likely not a perfect gender balance. This is still a work in progress (it always will be), but consider this list of names as a sample of the people I go to when I need to read something, whether to learn or to be inspired or to be challenged. Maybe a name or two in there can do the same for you.

If you have any recommendations of blogs you read, please do share! All the best for the week ahead.
