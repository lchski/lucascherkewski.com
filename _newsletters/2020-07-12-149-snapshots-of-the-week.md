Another quiet week for my brain—filled with family time and working time, with little else going on. And that’s okay!

Some snapshots of my week (in words because I’m not a photo guy):

- Bread pudding, more appetizing than it sounds. (Maybe just me, but the name isn’t a draw if you’ve never had it before.)
- Being supported by good colleagues (friends) at work, means so much.
- Eating takeout in a park, worth the postural pain. (I have weak core strength, so sitting on the ground to eat is not comfy for me. But it can be lovely!)
- Driving on country roads with sunny skies, lovely except for one’s environmental conscience.
- Data analysis during downtime—so, uh, relaxing?
- Reading for hours in a row, it’s nourishing! (This week, I continued with [_A Sand County Almanac_](https://www.aldoleopold.org/about/aldo-leopold/sand-county-almanac/) and started/almost finished [_The Fifth Season_](http://nkjemisin.com/books/the-fifth-season/).)
- Supporting the food spots you want to see through—restaurants, bakeries, and so on—is totally worth it. (Evidently food was a big part of the week, as seems so often the case.)

Okay, I’m out! But two links before I go: [how to ask good questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/), by Julia Evans; [on transformative justice and what we demand of it](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/you-were-supposed-to-give-me-salvation), by Ejeris Dixon via Mandy Brown.

All the best for the week ahead.
