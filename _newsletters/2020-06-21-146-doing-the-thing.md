Hello there!

It’s hot. A few years ago, I linked to [some articles on the social and political dimensions of heat](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/46-heat/), and [a newsletter issue by Charlie Loyd that discussed the social construction of disasters, including heat waves](https://lucascherkewski.com/links/2018/11/25/15-00-tinyletter-charlie-loyd-sauce/). Such analyses take on an extra dimension in pandemic times, as most seems to: socialized air conditioning (libraries, public buildings, malls) is mostly unavailable, increasing risk of heat-related injury.

I had a pretty serious bout of heat illness a few weeks ago—it was thanks to a kind friend who was willing to open their home that I didn’t ultimately have to seek medical attention. But doing that increased our virus risk, an unpleasant tradeoff. Folks without that option are especially at risk right now–while there are a few cooling centres open, the heat’s not breaking overnight. [Ottawa’s bound to get hotter in the years ahead](https://ottawa.ca/en/news/ottawa-will-get-warmer-and-wetter-year-round), and [air conditioning—the common defence—ultimately contributes to that heating](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/29/the-air-conditioning-trap-how-cold-air-is-heating-the-world).

So that’s all very fun. I have more thoughts on this to share at a future date, but something else happened this week that I should speak to.

On Thursday, [the prime minister announced a national exposure notification app, to help people in Canada realize when they may have been exposed to COVID-19](https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/06/18/prime-minister-announces-new-mobile-app-help-notify-canadians-covid).

[My team is working on this.](https://digital.canada.ca/partnerships/#exposure-notifications) I’ve been involved for a fair bit of the journey, in a policy capacity.

There are some guardrails to what I can say about this as a public servant, particularly given its profile and the work with provinces and territories. (As ever, [Kent’s piece on the death of public service anonymity has me thinking](http://www.cpsrenewal.ca/2017/03/public-service-anonymity-is-dead-long.html).)

It’s been on my mind, clearly—[my last letter linked to some pieces on equity considerations in using technology to respond to COVID-19](https://buttondown.email/lchski/archive/hit-and-miss-145-whos-watching/). Now that this has been announced, everybody can start discussing these issues more publicly: the public, experts and advocates, politicians, and public servants, and so on. And I look forward to that discussion! Critique is an essential part to avoiding harm, to identifying and resolving critical issues.

I don’t have too too much more to say on it right now, in part because I need to step away from screens and rest my eyes. There are mental notes in my head of what I’m observing from this experience, which will slowly take more coherent written form. But I do make an offer: if we know each other and you have questions about this app, please get in touch. That includes if you’re skeptical or have critiques, if you’re worried or anxious—I’m here to chat, and look forward to doing so.

Before I go, I want to leave you with two links. They’re both from _Active History_, a model for engaged history:

- “[So long Dundas: From Colonization to Decolonization Road?](https://activehistory.ca/2020/06/so-long-dundas-a-colonization-to-decolonization-road/)”—Thomas Peace discusses the history of Ontario’s various Dundas Streets (or Dundas as a community) and their symbolic and literal connections to both slavery and colonization. From this, Peace then offers some other names that surface those histories. It’s a really interesting piece, one that I think engages with the “(re|un)naming debate” in a constructive way.
- “[Epidemics and Racism: Honolulu’s Bubonic Plague and the Big Fire, 1899-1900](https://activehistory.ca/2020/06/epidemics-and-racism-honolulus-bubonic-plague-and-the-big-fire-1899-1900/)”—Yukari Takai walks us through how an epidemic unfolded in Honolulu over a hundred years ago, focusing particularly on how the city’s Asian and Indigenous communities were demonized in the public health response. Particularly interesting and troubling, to me, was the role of private citizens in directing the public health response, coupled with state violence (e.g., National Guard troopers forcing Asian and Indigenous residents of a quarantine zone to stay in it—with guns and bayonets—even while a massive fire raged through the buildings of that zone).

Both are excellent examples of how history can provide depth and context and nuance to current events, and offer considerations for what we do next.

That’s all from me for the week. All the best for the week ahead—may you find some cool air and space to reflect.
