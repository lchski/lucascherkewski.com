Well, it’s been quite the start to the year, hasn’t it?

It’s been a hard week in Ottawa, in Canada, and beyond. And [this morning Ontario Twitter came together over a nuclear incident that wasn’t](https://twitter.com/lchski/status/1216382344082468865). Personally, I’ve been mired in remembering certain periods of my life and comparing them to my present. Because that’s always fun and healthy.

So I’m trying to dig into the things that ground me.

While my roommate is taking an extended vacation, I’ve turned to podcasts and the radio (CBC Radio One, natch) to fill the silence of usually conversation-filled mealtimes. Last night, I caught up with a friend before taking myself out to [_80s Mix Tape with the NAC Orchestra_](https://nac-cna.ca/en/event/21737), which was a real treat, followed by watching _Ferris Bueller’s Day Off_. And this morning I’ve been catching up on newsletters and blogs with Cher playing in the background.

(On reflection, all the 80s stuff may actually be tied to my being mired in remembrance—it was definitely core to a certain period of my life. But it’s also great, feel-good entertainment, so I’m not about to drop it.) (Also, apologies: listening to Cher is delaying and disjointing my writing because I keep having to get up to dance.)

This has been a very _me, me, me_ letter—I apologize if that’s not your thing. I’ll close by sharing some wholesome links from my reading this morning, things that have warmed my heart on a cold, icy day, and may do the same for you:

- Simon Collison broke a six year hiatus and wrote [a year in review for 2019](https://colly.com/journal/twenty-nineteen-in-review). Simon’s ups and downs this year feel in part similar to my own, and I appreciate how openly he wrestles with where to go next. (Also [his site’s recent redesign](https://colly.com/journal/2019-in-personal-projects) is warm, thoughtful, inviting—an inspiration.)
- Diana Kimball shares [her experience with, reactions to, and reflections on initiating the “/mentoring project”](https://alwaysreadthemanual.com/read/issues/4/diana-kimball/article.html), wherein people would open themselves up for mentoring conversations by making a page on their website. I appreciate the discussion of how our work can get away from us, the challenge of relating to something that now feels beyond our control, or has unintended consequences for others.
- Jose Jimenez, a great colleague at CDS, recently left and wrote [a parting reflection on working as a student in a supportive, empowering environment](https://digital.canada.ca/2020/01/07/being-a-student-at-cds-taught-me-a-lot-about-trusting-myself/). It was a pleasure to know Jose, and his reflections ring true for me—the most effective management approach I know is to “hire good people and empower them”, regardless of their background or level of education.
- Liz Covart is a historian who curates and hosts the impressive, engaging, long-running _Ben Franklin’s World_ podcast on the history of early America. [Kurt Manwaring hosted Covart for one of his _10 Questions_ interviews](https://www.fromthedesk.org/10-questions-with-liz-covart/), speaking about making history accessible and more. (The kind of work Covart does seems, uh, #goals. [Thanks to Jo for introducing me to Covart!](https://twitter.com/jomac_613/status/1215101824631496707))
- Not a personal piece, but did you know that [porchetta (or, as it’s known locally, “porketta”) was (and maybe still is) a big deal in Sudbury](https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2012/01/09/sudburys_signature_dish_is_porketta.html)?

That’s all from me for this week. Thank you, as always, for hanging out with me in this space—it’s a special privilege of mine to write for you each Sunday. All the best for the week ahead, much love.
