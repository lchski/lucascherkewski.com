Hia,

I’m brained out from the heat and am thinking through a few ideas for future newsletters. (Plus, ruminating on whether to continue with the newsletter.) In the meantime, here are some of my favourite cool recipes for a hot day:

* *Parsley salad.* Chop a bunch of parsley roughly. Crush some garlic. Add a generous amount of olive oil, and a bit of vinegar (your choice as to the variety). Mix and enjoy. (adapted from Tamar Adler’s *An Everlasting Meal*)
* *Caprese salad.* Slice tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. Put the latter on top of the former. Top with basil leaves. Add olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper.
* *Bread.* Buy it fresh and eat it as-is. No extra heat required :)

All the best for the week ahead!
