The last days of September and first few of October are always special ones, but this week especially so. It was filled with anniversaries, birthdays, time with friends, and a wedding—lovely occasions, all of them.

Here in Ottawa, the leaves are changing, doing their thing—[the world going on](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/24/mary-oliver-reads-wild-geese/), as it were. It’s “Ottawautumn”, as I like to call it—this city seems meant for the fall and winter seasons.

Three links for you this week:

- At this week’s [Toronto Data Workshop](https://rohanalexander.com/toronto_data_workshop.html), Florence V. Dubois presented some of the data work underlying her doctoral dissertation. The data [combines biographical data about Canadian Members of Parliament with demographic data from their ridings at (or near) the time of their election](https://florencevdubois.github.io/datasets.html). Florence published [a short Twitter thread that summarizes the work involved in such a project](https://twitter.com/florencevdubois/status/1296872762976370688). To me, it’s a wonderful example of research infrastructure, or [facilitating access](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/125-facilitating-access/): combining available data in a rigorous way _and sharing it publicly, so others can build on it for their own research_. (And, of course, I’m a fan, given the subject!)
- Julia Evans shared [a cheatsheet to what different brackets mean in bash / shell scripting](https://wizardzines.com/comics/brackets-cheatsheet/). [Her zines are always informative, diving deep into what makes programming possible.](https://wizardzines.com/)
- Finally, a piece that I read right after sending last week’s newsletter. It’s so good I considered sending out an issue “160.5”, as it fit well with last week’s theme. [Mandy Brown makes “the case for rereading”.](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/case-for-rereading) It’s an excellent argument for reading, and re-reading, and reading as thinking, and references a number of rewarding books. (I’ve always admired how she includes [a “canon” section in her reading list](https://aworkinglibrary.com/collections/canon/).)

That’s it from me for today! I need to get cozy and do some reading. All the best for the week ahead!
