Does education work? By “education” I mean the whole formal system we have, plus its informal supplements—elementary and secondary schools, post-secondary education, plus all the other places we learn how to live. (Picture me _gesturing wildly at the bigness of it all_ as I say that.)

After going through the educational system, what should an individual have? To me, the best gift an educational experience can give is that of new or refined frames for thought, thinking frames.

At its simplest, a thinking frame is a set of questions or exercises. These frames help us respond to different situations.

For example, we might have a frame for writing an essay. My essay frame is usually one of nested questions: my essays each answer one very high level question by knitting together different sections; these sections each address a different question; these specific questions are highly focused, but related to the overall question. This frame makes it easier for me to write an essay when faced with an undirected topic: I first need to find an overall question (a process that’s guided by other thinking frames), then I can break it down and get writing.

But we can also have frames for how we live life. I’ve been slowly assembling a thinking frame for how I interact with others, especially those who—from my perspective—have or may hurt me. This frame centres around widening myself and embracing “others” (while denying the idea that they’re really other)—[Ursula Franklin and David Whyte articulate it well](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/franklin-other-us/).

These frames often go unnoticed. I reckon that the folks we call “smart”—those who readily accomplish the activities associated with the conventional image of success—have, for whatever reason, instinctively developed thinking frames that allow them to do what they’re good at. Those folks who struggle with school may not have developed those frames—instead, they likely have their own instinctive thinking frames that facilitate their success with other activities.

In either case, I think there’s benefit to making our thinking frames explicit. What that looks like would vary—here, I’ve highlighted only the edges of two of the frames on which I rely. But thinking about how we think, and deciding whether we accept those frames or not, seems an important process. It improves self awareness—we realize why we think and act the way we do—and it gives us a chance to nudge ourselves toward a different way of living, of thinking and acting.

Anywho, that’s what’s on my mind this glorious Sunday. All the best for the week ahead!
