A very happy, beautiful Sunday to you!

Endings and beginnings are times for reflection. [Last week’s newsletter](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/69-returning-home/) considered my time back in Waterloo, and the space for reflection offered by returning home. This week, I’d like to discuss, in a related but different way, memory and remembering. (By next week I reckon I’ll have something to say that’s less centred on me.)

Yesterday, at the suggestion of a coworker, I worked through the first half of [YearCompass’s year-in-review/planning the year ahead booklet](https://yearcompass.com/). To do so, I first walked through my entire calendar for 2018, noting events that were significant to me for different reasons.

> This youthful reading can be literally formative in that it gives a form or shape to our future experiences … things which continue to operate in us even when we remember little or nothing about the book we read when young. When we reread the book in our maturity, we then rediscover these constants which by now form part of our inner mechanisms though we have forgotten where they came from. There is a particular potency in the work which can be forgotten in itself but which leaves its seed behind in us.




Kundera on memory

> For after all, what can memory actually do, the poor thing? It is only capable of retaining a paltry little scrap of the past, and no one knows why just this scrap and not some other one, since in each of us the choice occurs mysteriously, outside our will or our interests. (123–124)

> Everyone is wrong about the future. Man can only be certain about the present moment. But is that quite true either? Can he really know the present? Is he in a position to make any judgment about it? Certainly not. For how can a person with no knowledge of the future understand the meaning of the present? If we do not know what future the present is leading us toward, how can we say whether this present is good or bad, whether it deserves our concurrence, or our suspicion, or our hatred? (143–144)



Harris on memory

> Computers cannot remember at all; they can only recall. it’s strange this distinction isn’t made more often. Real memories divide, mutate, live. … Through a brain process called reconsolidating, every retrieval of a given memory actually changes it. … “We don’t remember people as they were; we remember them as _we_ are.” (204)




revisiting the year int he year in review exercise, realizing all the things I’d forgotten, how certain events loomed larger in my memory than others, how events that had at the time seemed inconsequential actually feel much more so now [Kundera, present has now sense but in the future]




A year is a long time—far more fits into and happens over the course of a year than we may appreciate. I wonder, too, whether there’s something of Kundera’s paradox of youth at play here: for a younger person, like myself, a year represents a larger fraction of my life,
