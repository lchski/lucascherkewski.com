Hello! Things have been quite busy here the last few weeks, but the end is in sight, with quieter, calmer days ahead. T suggested—whether she realized it or not—that I capture some of the activities and routines that have kept us going as we’re been juggling so much. A, however, is passionately expressing his hunger, so I’m on the clock as I write this!

- Date squares at Planet Coffee, best enjoyed under the trees as they slowly change colour (the leaves are taking their time this year, thank goodness!)
- Friendship walks to Moo Shu, always sampling at least one new / seasonal flavour in my two-scoop waffle
- Catching up with old CDS colleagues, a good reminder of how lovely the folks there were, and a chance to realize a few of us would all be in town in a few weeks for [FWD50](https://www.fwd50.com/)
- Hanging out at Ottawa City Woodshop, whether plugging away at a personal project or working on a course (and discovering you’re the only person in a course and having a blast with the ever-generous [Martin Thornell](https://www.instagram.com/martinthornell/))
- Watching _M\*A\*S\*H_ on a quiet evening
- Perusing [my favourite feeds and newsletters](https://lucascherkewski.com/rolls/) via Feedbin (that page needs updating, but much of it still holds up)

Any activity or routine you’ve been returning to lately, to keep going? I hope you get to do it soon, if you need or want to. All the best for the week ahead!
