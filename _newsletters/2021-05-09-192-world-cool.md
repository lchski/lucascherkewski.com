Hello!

Just a few links for you today. I spent much of the weekend reading, finishing _Dune_ for a book club this afternoon. I realized that most of the books I’ve finished this year have been thanks to that book club—friendly social pressure, it works!

- Mita Williams recorded [a Jane’s Walk talk on Windsor, Ontario’s electrical grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL6vgzgChMg) (Jane’s Walks!), shared via her [ever-interesting University of Winds newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/UniversityOfWinds).
- [Design Patterns for Mental Health](https://designpatternsformentalhealth.org/) – the name says it all, and I’m quite a fan. (Shared with me originally by [Sam](https://www.samsadasivan.ca/).) In particular, I’m thinking about the [“Design for poor internet connection” pattern](https://designpatternsformentalhealth.org/patterns/design-for-poor-internet-connection/) – still all too common in Canada, even in urban areas, but especially in rural areas.
- A [rocket came down](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57045058), which has me thinking of [space junk](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/28/the-elusive-peril-of-space-junk), which has me thinking of [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/), a game I first played over nine years ago, in which you create a lot of space junk. Early versions of the game were not very computationally efficient, and you were incentivized to _not_ overload space with junk, because otherwise your gameplay slowed to a laggy crawl. If only overtaxed common resources had quite the same influence in reality.

Anyhow, time to go listen to some [very wholesome StatsCan census playlists](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/soundtrack-bandesonore/index-eng.htm) and [the 1971 JINGLE from this CENSUS INFLUENCER’S KIT](https://census.gc.ca/resources-ressources/influencers-kit-trousse-influenceurs/completion-participation-eng.htm) (via [Courtney](https://twitter.com/sidewalkballet)). Regarding both of these: WHAT IS THE 21^ST CENTURY!?

All the best for the week ahead!

Lucas
