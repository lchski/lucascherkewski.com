_nervous laughter_ It’s February!?

I know, I know, mentioning time passing is as clichéd as talking about the weather. But, goodness, it’s just zooming along.

I love February—I +1 my age (as do some folks close to me), it’s consistently cold and snowy (indulge me—I suffer all summer), and the days steadily lengthen! I’m glad it’s here _and_ shocked that it’s already ¼ gone. As a friend and I often say to one another, _what is tiiiiime!?_

So anyway, let’s talk about the weather.

One of my techniques for making the most of winter is to, as I call it, “chase the sun”. When it’s sunny outside, I just _go_, get outside and walk with it fully in my face. If I’m too busy  (the working life do be like that sometimes), I’ll shift to a sunny corner of the apartment, basking while I can.

Similarly, I view the year in two broad seasons: “walk in the sun” and “walk in the shade”. You can guess which months correspond to which season :) In walk in the sun season, walks and time outside privilege sunny spots—I choose pathways and routes unobstructed by buildings or landscapes. 

We’re firmly in walk in the sun season. When it’s overcast all day, there’s little we can do about that. But I try to check in throughout each day—have I chased the sun today? If not, I’ll look for the best opportunity, even if it’s just to walk under bright clouds.

I hope you get a chance to chase the sun today, if that’s your thing.

All the best for the week ahead!
