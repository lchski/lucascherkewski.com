This week, [Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc Kukpi7 (Chief) Rosanne
Casimir shared the heavy announcement that the bodies of 215 children were found on the former grounds of the Kamloops Indian Residential School](https://tkemlups.ca/wp-content/uploads/05-May-27-2021-TteS-MEDIA-RELEASE.pdf). These were students, whose well-being had been entrusted to the care of the Indian Residential School system. [Kukpi7 Casimir, via Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, captures well the complex emotions of this announcement](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-discovery-of-a-mass-grave-at-a-former-residential-school-is-just/): 

> And we should be sad; it is horrific. But it is not shocking. In fact, it is the opposite – a too-common unearthing of the legacy, and enduring reality, of colonialism in Canada. To the degree it is shocking, it is evidence of how much learning there is still to do.

> Kukpi7 Rosanne Casimir, the chief of Tk’emlups te Secwepemc First Nation, said it best: She called the discovery of the mass grave an “unthinkable loss.” But as she importantly made clear, it was also a known loss – that is, the deaths were undocumented, but the community “had knowledge” of them.

[Cindy Blackstock has been sharing numerous resources to learn more.](https://twitter.com/cblackst/status/1398394218469638147) The First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, of which Blackstock is executive director, has more information on the [Honouring Memories, Planting Dreams campaign, which encourages you to plant a heart garden to honour those lost to Canada’s residential school policy](https://fncaringsociety.com/honouring-memories-planting-dreams). Also, [via Tanya Talaga, a thread on current conditions in First Nations schools](https://twitter.com/maggie_wente/status/1398816961195384833).

I’ll be taking some time to revisit Talaga’s _Seven Fallen Feathers_ and _All Our Relations_, both of which deal with the long lasting legacy of residential schools. You can [listen to the latter as the 2018 Massey Lectures](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-2018-cbc-massey-lectures-all-our-relations-finding-the-path-forward-1.4763007).

All the best for the week ahead—whatever you can muster, we try our best, despite the gloom that sometimes seems so persistent for those with caring hearts.
