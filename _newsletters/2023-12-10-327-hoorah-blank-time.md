Hullo! A good Sunday to you :) It’s been a good week—I was, unusually, somewhat on the ball in getting up when I meant to; it makes a huge change in the day, knowing I started it somewhat in control, and the extra bit of time before things get going relaxes me immensely. 

Birds are hanging out in the hedge by our kitchen window, at least fifteen at a time—good company as winter sets in. Hopefully we’re as entertaining for them as they are for us!

- [Anne Helen Petersen’s analysis of “over-meeting culture”](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-root-of-over-meeting-culture) hit home during a week when I—quite unusually—had a few days with only zero to one meetings. They were productive in a different way, as I had a bit more breathing room for the “blank time” Petersen points to as an important component of productivity; small things like emptying the dishwasher or doing a quick sweep reoriented my brain and body. With h/t to Sean, there was [a good brief follow-up on this between David Yee and Mandy Brown](https://mstdn.social/@aworkinglibrary/111534752987967145), on the managerial style that leans into this kind of culture. All good things to reflect on as the year wraps up.
- I’d forgotten about the [delightful “I thought about that a lot” yearly “24 days til Christmas” newsletter](https://www.ithoughtaboutthatalot.com/), until the issues started rolling into my reader the other day. [The most recent, on loneliness, is a good example of the form](https://www.ithoughtaboutthatalot.com/2023/loneliness): written anonymously, there’s room for the author to self-disclose more than they might otherwise, with thoughtful, intimate pieces as a result.
-	[This year, Erin Kissane thought a lot about networks](https://erinkissane.com/root-and-branch), and it’s been edifying to follow along. [Kissane’s “Meta in Myanmar” project](https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-full-series) is difficult, important reading about the very real human costs of decisions made by faraway tech companies—and how our extensive connectivity can so easily enable decisions dramatically disconnected from the people they affect.
-	[Paul Wells shared some music recommendations from 2023](https://paulwells.substack.com/p/attention-christmas-shoppers), and it’s apparently time for me to listen to the live album from Bleachers, for its Springsteen-inspired (and very real Springsteen) vibes.
- I like the idea of [“craft questions”](https://robwalker.substack.com/p/how-and-why-to-ask-craft-questions).
- I’ve filed this [description of “humanist technologist”](https://werd.io/2023/being-a-humanist-technologist) under my “who-i-want-to-be” bookmark tag.

I think it’s time for T and I to go do some birdwatching in the nearby park. All the best for the week ahead!
