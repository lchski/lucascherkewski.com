I’m cozied up in bed, looking out a big window on snow-covered trees, a few birds hopping form branch to branch, doing the quiet work of staying alive on this bright, cold winter’s day.

Life can carry a predictable rhythm. At the year’s scale, I think, there are patterns to our days, things we think about or do with some regularity.

[This time of year seems often to bring me to Milan Kundera’s _Ignorance_, for example.](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/69-returning-home/) And I recently tried to explain why I like Springsteen—well, [turns out I wrote about just that almost two years ago](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/springsteen-broadway/). Something about the heavy snow and quiet days that inspires reflection, I suppose.

This’ll be my last note for 2020. It’s been quite a year, hasn’t it? We’re still here, you and I, and for that I’m grateful. This year has shown me two key things:

- At the personal scale, it’s okay to not expect too much—small wins are enough.
- At the societal scale, we can pull off incredible feats—there’s a vaccine in arms before our _annus horribilis_ has finished. Now, that vaccine built on decades of prior research. That *too* is incredible.

It’s also driven home the importance of quiet, regular motions. I miss the loud, bright days of pre-pandemic life. But the small, the grounded—they’re good for me, too.

The days ahead will remain quiet. My site’s demanding a redesign—time to make my “[digital house a home](https://colly.com/articles/this-used-to-be-our-playground)”—and I’ve a book or two (or more… hehe).

But I’d like to hear from you, if you’re up for it! Normally I’d visit friends these year-end weeks—let’s adapt that tradition. How are you doing? Have you read or watched or listened to anything that struck you? Any interesting walks, any interesting conversations? Send me an email, send me a text, give me a call—let’s share in these quiet days and the joy of each other’s company.

All the best for the week—and year—ahead. Sending you a big virtual embrace, my friend. We’re still here, and we’ll continue muddling through together, doing the quiet work of staying alive.
