Hello! The change of season feels solidly here, but looking forward to formally welcoming the fall tomorrow. Full weekend of visiting still ahead, so just the links this week. 

- “[Resurrecting ice age ponds](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/20/just-add-water-how-to-bring-back-ancient-plants-in-a-norfolk-ghost-pond)” is the best subtitle for an article. From how they find the old ponds—historical maps, place names, and satellite imagery—to the process of recreating the ponds—including a few words from the excavator operator—it’s all a delight.
- Jeffrey Zeldman elegantly captures how the “[who cares era](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/)“ shows up in [the modern medical system](https://zeldman.com/2025/09/19/everybodys-lost-it-part-i/). While US-twinged, there’s a lot here that rings true elsewhere.
- Gina Trapani on [how she spent time on sabbatical](https://notetoself.studio/post/when-its-time-to-take-a-sabbatical/).
- Winnie Lim on conceiving [exercise not as “improving” your body, but as maintaining it](https://winnielim.org/journal/preserving-and-growing-our-energy-capacity/)—as building the capacity for whatever your day throws at you.
- “Consistency” as a trap in legal writing, and in praise instead of “[humanist legal drafting](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2025/09/20/Makes-Writing-Worse)”.
- June Chow shares the inadvertent discovery that [a series of microfilm reels crucial to Chinese-Canadian history were set to be destroyed](https://activehistory.ca/blog/2025/09/17/near-destruction-chinese-canadian-records-at-library-and-archives-canada/), with no apparent justification.

All the best for the week ahead!
