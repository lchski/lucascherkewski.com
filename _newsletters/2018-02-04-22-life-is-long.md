[***ADD PHOTO OF INDEX CARD***]

We’re motoring right along, aren’t we? It’s February 2018, though apparently my brain doesn’t quite realize it—I wrote down “December 2” as the date on Friday.

I’m sitting in the middle of two wild weeks, enjoying a moment of calm. Co-op interviews are in full swing this week and next (I’ve never tied a tie so many times in my life), so I’ve been reflecting frequently on the future.

Specifically, I’ve been reflecting on a peculiar conundrum: there are so many possible options for jobs, all exciting and all rewarding. At times, the choice feels definitive and permanent: whatever I choose now, I’m locked in. But in stepping back I realize that that’s not true. In so doing, I turn to a little mantra that I‘ve been reciting recently: *Life is long.*

There’s time to experience different pursuits. There’s time to slow down and enjoy a nice moment when you run into one. There’s time to mess up and fall down; there’s time too to stand up and correct yourself. We can pack many experiences into a life; if something doesn’t happen today, there’s tomorrow or next week or next year.

This flies in the face of the oft-bandied “life is short” mantra, which is wrapped up with all sorts of other ideas like “live your life to the fullest” or “live in the moment”. I don’t think these ideas require a “life is short” mentality. I think they’re just as valid when applied to life in the longest sense.

The key here is to differentiate between a long life of complacency and a long life of variety. Of course, if you’re content with where you are, then there’s no need to change. But recognizing that few choices are truly eternal pushes me to try out new things.

Life is long, but the days are short. I’ve still got much to do, and maybe you do, too. Before you go, consider listening to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZdiXvDU4P0), which I think nicely captures some of this sentiment. Thank you for spending a bit of your day with me. All the best for the week ahead!
