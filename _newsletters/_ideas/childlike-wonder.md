[cut from #75, on looking at _The Smiths_:]

As I started looking at it, I heard giggles beside me. A young child, maybe three or four, was running around the pool of water in the adjoining room. As I continued looking at my painting, the child continued their exploration of the pool and the benches surrounding it. At times, I turned to look not at the painting, but at the child, enjoying their sense of wonder. (They were quite content to play with the pond—when it was time for them to go, the child let out some impressive wails.)
