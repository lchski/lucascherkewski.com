HELLO! I’m writing to you late, after a nourishing weekend of housework, walking, and friends (new and old alike). I’m leaving October on a high.

With luck, that high will carry me well through November. But it’s a tough month. [November is the first month of Vonnegut’s season of “locking”](https://austinkleon.com/2018/12/22/four-or-more-seasons/) (or [Vermont’s “stick season”](https://kottke.org/19/10/kurt-vonnegut-there-are-six-seasons-instead-of-four))—the leaves are gone, but the snow’s not yet here; the days are short and often overcast; and there are no holidays to celebrate (at least, not here).

Nonetheless, I’m resolved to get through November with as good a spirit as I can muster. I’ve put together a “November survival guide”, a list of activities to set myself right when the world knocks me awry.

One of the main enablers is to be _decisive_. Rather than fretting over what to do, it’s to quickly move to _something_. Here are just some of those possibilities from my list:

- Go to a local dog park at the end of the workday
- Enjoy a warm drink in a sunlit park, reading poetry (or [listening to the late, great Mary Oliver](https://lucascherkewski.com/links/2021/10/26/21-00-onbeing-mary-oliver-listening-to-the-world/))
- Watch _Gilmore Girls_ and work through the sudoku pile
- Indulge in a midweek movie night (maybe [choose one of the feel-good movies from your pandemic movie weekends list](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/pandemic-movie-weekends/))
- Watch an opera
- Go on a super long walk, full of water and trees
- Pick up an old data project
- Read children’s literature
- Call your grandparents—spend time with the long view
- For almost any of these—invite friends to join in!

And, [for many more ideas, Caitlyn Greffly asked for what to “do in the evening after work that doesn’t involve screens”](https://twitter.com/thecaitcode/status/1451353379133820928).

How do you get through November? Or do you love it? (If so, please tell me why!) Here’s to a hopefully all-good month :) All the best for the week ahead!
