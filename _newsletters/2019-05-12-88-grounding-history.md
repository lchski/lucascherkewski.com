Hi!

A hopefully happy Sunday to you.

Folks who spend time with me know that I’m very interested in local history, human and otherwise. Often this manifests in my tendency to read every plaque I come across—plaques, problematic as forms of public history though they can be, physically represent historical events and people, often in a significant place. Some people wonder at this interest of mine, asking why I spend so much time feeding it.

Walking along the Canal yesterday, I was finally able to articulate why I take such a strong interest in local history.

I have a tendency to constantly turn thoughts over in my head. **I replay conversations I recently had.** I play act at conversations I expect to have soon. Since I walk without music, these are the thoughts that occupy me on my frequent rambles.

When something’s bothering me or taking up time in my life, it occupies a lot of space in my head. This can be exhausting.

Local history offers a remedy.

When I’m out walking, knowing historical oddities about the area around me offers another point of focus. It draws me out of the thinking quagmire. For example, walking along the Canal I think of its various historical twists and turns, from the [reason for its winding course](https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/the-capital-builders-how-a-scandalous-land-deal-forever-altered-ottawa) to [its near destruction in the early 1900s](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/the-time-we-nearly-filled-in-that-practically-useless-stretch-of-waterway-known-as-the-rideau-canal) (all for [a railway tunnel that, 100 years later, we’ve finally kinda built](https://www.ottawamatters.com/remember-this/remember-this-the-cross-city-tunnel-1430700)). There’s more to note about the Canal, and there’s just as much about the rest of the city. Learning local history grounds me.

It’s funny—the past prevents me from overthinking the present day. Both in the moment, and in a broader sense, this is part of [why I study history instead of a technical discipline](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/why-not-design-school/)—to gain a sense of perspective.

All the best for the week ahead!
