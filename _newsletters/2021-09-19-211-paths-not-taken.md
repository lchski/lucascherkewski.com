Hello!

It’s a wonderfully sunny Sunday here in Ottawa. The political folks are out on the hustings across the country (don’t forget to [vote tomorrow, if you haven’t already](https://elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=vote&document=index&lang=e)!), my pal [Sean Boots is blogging](https://sboots.ca/2021/09/18/suggestions-for-the-next-minister-of-digital-government/), and [the LRT has derailed again](https://twitter.com/jchianello/status/1439638018365825032)—in other words, a pretty normal September Sunday.

I spent the last few weeks in Waterloo, visiting with family and unwinding a bit before diving back into work during the fall. Being there often reminds me of paths not taken—it was a “point of departure” for me. Coming to Ottawa was one path, but there were certainly others I’d considered at the time. Being in Waterloo resurfaces those alternatives, leaving me to wonder at “what if”.

Too much “what if” can put you in a funk, depending how you frame things! But returning to Ottawa always reminds me that I’m happy with the path I took, the one I’m on. I’m in a good spot here, for which I’m grateful.

Anyhow, I’m in the process of unpacking and reestablishing myself here—groceries to buy, food to cook, paths to walk. This week was mostly visiting family and friends, so I don’t have any links to share. I’ve started reading N.K. Jemisin’s _Inheritance_ books, which I’m quite enjoying thus far. If you have any good reads you’d recommend, I’d love to hear about them!

All the best for the week ahead!
