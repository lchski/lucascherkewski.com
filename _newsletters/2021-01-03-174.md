Hellooooo! I hope you’re doing well.

The snow is on the trees in the most picturesque way here, feeling properly like winter and the holiday season (though that’s almost over, I suppose).

I’ve had a very chill few days—watching operas (it was Pavarotti week at [the Met’s daily free stream](https://www.metopera.org/user-information/nightly-met-opera-streams/)), playing _Civ VI_ (as a mercantilist French state, nestled around the fiery slopes of Eyjafjallajökull), and generally just not overdoing it.

Over the course of these days, I’ve encountered some good links!

1. This first one’s a heavy one. _Maclean’s_ has launched “an obituary project to commemorate thousands of coronavirus victims”. [_They Were Loved_ shares short, moving obituaries to lives lost from the pandemic.](https://www.macleans.ca/they-were-loved/) They were—are—loved, indeed.
2. The critical analysis you didn’t know you were looking for—[Tressie McMillan Cottom dives into the feminism of Hallmark movies](https://tressiemcphd.medium.com/the-feminist-hallmark-movie-universe-bae64a7f2059).
3. Two interesting economic analyses: [immigration has little-to-no effect on the wages of people already in a country](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-immigration-doesnt-reduce-wages); [an empty homes tax will do *something* for the housing market, but expectations should be set appropriately low](https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2020/12/07/what-to-expect-from-an-empty-homes-tax/). (I really admire *Mountain Doodles* for sharing their [posts as code _with the data analysis built in_](https://github.com/mountainMath/doodles/blob/master/content/posts/2020-12-07-what-to-expect-from-an-empty-homes-tax.Rmarkdown).)
4. Chris Coyier has it right: [_Feedbin_ plus a desktop / mobile feed reader like _NetNewsWire_ is a fantastic way to keep up with blogs](https://css-tricks.com/netnewswire-and-feedbin/). And blogs—they’re great!
5. _Future Fonts_ is a unique typeface marketplace (okay this is very niche, I know). You can [buy a typeface in its earliest stages of development, receive free updates, and read the designer’s thought process as they go](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/). The earlier you buy, the cheaper the typeface—a great way to support early career type designers. (I’m noodling with a website redesign, so you _know_ I’m poking around here a bunch.)
6. The wild year-end story about a pasta conspiracy that you didn’t know you needed: “[Why is there a Bucatini shortage in America?](https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/12/2020-bucatini-shortage-investigation.html)” (For any in Ottawa who need, I think I have some bucatini in my strategic pasta reserves. Yes, those are a real thing in my life.)

All the best for the week ahead, friend!
