Hi friends!

It’s been a busy weekend for me—packing things up, cleaning, and more of the above. I’ve accumulated a fair number of links to share, but they’ll have to wait for next week.

“Loading” is a good way to describe how things feel: bit by bit, things are coming together. Personally, at least. The world... well, we’ll dive into that next week.

All the best for the week ahead!

Lucas
