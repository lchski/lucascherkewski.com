Between time-change jet lag, some more responsibilities at work, and a fair bit else on the go, I haven’t yet fully appreciated the “longer days”—I’m so tired by day’s end, I just want to fall asleep, brighter light or not. But that hasn’t held me back from accumulating a few interesting links to share:

- Lost Art Press published [a profile of Andy Glenn, a welcome meditation on integrating work and life](https://blog.lostartpress.com/2024/03/17/meet-the-author-andy-glenn/) as we emerge from the season of rest, into a season of work. I think about how physical proximity enables this integration, too, even in office work—how working from home allows people to be more present in the lives and rhythms of their household (for better and for worse!). 
- Continuing my Nonno’s advice from last week, that some things you have to live to understand, [John Cutler shared some product (management) ways of thinking that often require experiencing before they sink in](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-278-the-power-of-firsthand-experience).
- Looking up [Mosaic](https://uwdata.github.io/mosaic/), profiled in the [latest release of Observable Framework](https://github.com/observablehq/framework/releases/tag/v1.3.0), I realized that the [UW Interactive Data Lab](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/) (University of Washington, not that other UW more familiar to Canadians) is behind many of the people and projects shaping dataviz on the web today. Two examples: Mike Bostock, founder of Observable and creator of [D3](https://d3js.org/), was a PhD student there; the lab produced [Arquero](https://uwdata.github.io/arquero/), an excellent data processing library that brings much of the [R tidyverse’s `dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) approach to the web. Things connect!
- Continuing on the theme of [“thinking about and working with data in interesting ways”, Mita Williams’s newsletter from yesterday had a number of great links](https://www.uofwinds.com/375/). In particular, check out the discussion of the [Time Zone Generator](https://timezoneprotocols.space/generator/).

All the best for the week ahead!
