Good afternoon!

Last night, I started watching [_Beverly Hills Cop_](https://letterboxd.com/film/beverly-hills-cop/), thinking I’d do a few sudokus while tuning in and out of the action. A few minutes in, I realized I wanted something that appealed more to my emotional side, and switched to watching [_Sleeping With Other People_](https://letterboxd.com/film/sleeping-with-other-people/) after the first action scene, while Eddie Murphy’s character is holding on in the back of a veering cigarette truck. Imagine my surprise when Jason Sudeikis’s character in _Sleeping With Other People_ later references _that exact scene_ toward the end of the movie! I love serendipitous moments like that.

Sudeikis is a delight in _Ted Lasso_, and it’s fun to see his and Alison Brie’s chemistry in _Sleeping With Other People_, a bit of a raunchy rom-com. I always enjoy rom-coms that end with the two characters _not_ together, though they’re pretty rare—only [_Prime_](https://letterboxd.com/film/prime/) comes to mind—since I think it’s an important counterpoint to the “all’s happy in the end” narrative most rom-coms promote. (Though maybe my views on that differ depending on whether I’m in or out of a relationship at the time….) This movie could easily have ended that way, and I thought it was going to, though the twist bringing us to the proper end was good fun. (I’m thinking, too, of Lasso’s support for “rom-communism”, from the season 2 episode “Rainbow”. While we’re [on the topic of _Ted Lasso_, I enjoyed this—spoiler-filled—discussion of the shows themes and storylines](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/09/opinions/ted-lasso-season-2-perry-gabriele/index.html).)

The only non-rom-com link I have to share this week is [an insightful analysis of the equalization referendum currently unfolding in Alberta](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/opinion-alberta-equalization-referendum-boessenkool-wesley-1.6201822). While I don’t take a particularly strong view on the question itself—other than that I’m glad the authors debunk some common misconceptions about equalization—I really enjoyed the authors’ discussion of Alberta’s current ability to secure a different bargain, and how this referendum may or may not affect it.

I’m off to tend to some sauce and bake biscuits for a Thanksgiving gathering with friends. I hope this weekend finds you happily wandering or spending time with loved ones, be they family, friends, or otherwise. All the best for the week ahead!
