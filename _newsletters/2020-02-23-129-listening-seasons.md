Maybe the groundhog was right—spring feels on its way. We’ve a run of above-zero days, the [Canal has closed “until further notice”](https://twitter.com/NCC_Skateway/status/1231335942683865090), and the air is gradually hosting more birdsong. Oh, and the days are steadily lengthening.

The river near my apartment has kept large patches of open water this winter—a change from last year, when it maintained its frozen breadth into the first weeks of March. [It wasn’t until the second week of March that I noticed the signs of spring last year.](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/79-the-signs/) Year to year, the dates change, but the signs remain similar.

But this is Ottawa. I’m sure there’ll be more snow yet, an April ice storm or two before everything opens back up. And I’m okay with that. While winter invariably gets me down a bit, the darkness and closedness, it’s a comfy season, manageable like no other.
