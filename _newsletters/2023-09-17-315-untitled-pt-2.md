Hello!

In the midst of vacation, trying to channel [Rach Smith’s “no inputs day”](https://rachsmith.com/no-inputs-day/). It’s… hard! Changing context helps, of course, but those inputs are always just a tap away. That said, this week, in a moment where I just wanted some familiar things to read, I enjoyed this [interview with a power duo in Welsh antiques](https://blog.lostartpress.com/2023/09/10/meet-the-authors-tim-and-betsan-bowen/) (lol), on how they’ve made their life interests into their life’s work (and an integral part of their lives together). 

Okay, back to no (little?) inputs—more soon! All the best for the week ahead!
