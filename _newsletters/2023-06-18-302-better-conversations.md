Hello!

Sunny, blue skies have emerged from an overcast morning (though I like the gloom, some days—it encourages a general feeling of quiet, a welcome break from noise and hubbub). My brain is full of project ideas, and I’m looking forward to the slow days of summer for a chance to make those projects a reality.

Links links links!

- For so many reasons, I am very happy to see the depth and breadth of coverage coming out of [the Globe’s _Secret Canada_ project, which last week launched a database of Canadian freedom of information requests](https://www.secretcanada.com/). (The [“behind the scenes” pieces in their blog are also excellent](https://www.secretcanada.com/news).) There have been many [pieces published under the Secret Canada banner this year](https://theglobeandmail.com/topics/secret-canada/)—a favourite from the last week discusses [the connection between federal information requests, immigration policy, and the service approach of the federal immigration department](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-immigration-applications-access-requests/). Brilliant stuff that I’m glad to see discussed publicly.
- Vass Bednar with two great issues of _regs to riches_ this week: one on [interoperability through the lens of strollers](https://www.regs2riches.com/p/strolling) and another on [the quiet power of legislating labeling requirements](https://www.regs2riches.com/p/what-tech-policy-can-learn-from-textiles?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email).
- L.M. Sacasas [contrasting care to control, particularly in the raising (and surveillance) of children](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/care-not-control).
- Justin Ling with some interesting discussion on [“retreating” in debate, as a method to advance discussion instead of wedging extremes](https://www.bugeyedandshameless.com/p/concede-the-point). Not easy!
- But I think that’d appeal to Paul Wells, who’s been writing a lot about having better conversations (individually and nationally). This week, he wrote about [one such conversation—or series thereof—that took place in Ottawa, a conference he describes as an “amiably chaotic event” reflecting on how  Canada responded to the pandemic](https://paulwells.substack.com/p/governing-in-crisis-and-not-snapping), not seeking to establish a position, but simply to allow its participants to confer. Ottawa Civic Tech used to offer a similar, though much lower key, type of “amiably chaotic” space to meet and get to know folks you might not otherwise—a type of space that definitely feels missing as various groups re-find their footing.
- On the [predictable increase of unpredictable turbulence due to climate change](https://www.theverge.com/23758593/flight-turbulence-climate-change-research-planes-airlines).
- Finally, for yet more links, I never regret dipping into Austin Kleon’s weekly newsletter—the latest has [a collection I really enjoyed this week](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/books-are-made-out-of-books).

All the best for the week ahead!
