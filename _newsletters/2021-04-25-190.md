Public health pickle?
- spaced out regimen
- CDC advice on what to do when fully vaccinated—Canada doesn't have equivalent for one dose
- Robyn Urback column etc, ppl will do what they'll do
- Dr. Tam on single dose? https://twitter.com/cmaconthehill/status/1384903082002329607
- pickle:
	- we don't really know what one-dose means (we know it offers some protection, obviously, or we wouldn’t be doing it)
	- we want people to be confident, to think taking the vaccine is worthwhile
	- comms / public messaging reflects our lack of knowledge, our cautiousness
	- what might harm reduction messaging look like? people with one dose may well feel inclined to gather—what advice do we give to them? is it bubbling—strictly—with other one-dosed "households" (see difficulty of age bucketing, younger wouldn't have yet)? can one-dosed grandparents get together with one family? etc
	- similar to policy recommendation from the ON Science Advisory Table (idk which table it really is), that, given people are going to socialize, we should be clear and tell them to do so outside, with masks, two metres apart—it'll happen, give people positive advice to enable safe behaviour!


- social malaise, what to talk about
- not reading as much as I used to
