Whew! My brain and body are tired. The kind of tiredness that’s a sign of both a good weekend, and a hopefully excellent night’s sleep to come.

That to say, I don’t have the energy brain capacity to do the elegant jump between how we budget our money (the envelope approach [with virtual envelopes, of course, software is great], plus [YNAB’s Four Rules](https://www.ynab.com/the-four-rules), notably “rule two” that has you set aside a little money each month to build up to big _eventual_ expenses) and deferred maintenance (where you put off fixing something due to lack of resources [generally money], or underinvest in needed maintenance). Instead, point form:

- I’d added up how much I _should_ have saved by now in my “technology replacement” category (which covers things like phone, laptop, watch, etc) for upcoming expenses and realized I was about 23% short, or eight months underinvested.
- And, seeing that shortfall, I totally get the psychological forces of deferred maintenance. “We’ll find the money when we need it, we have other uses for it today!” is a powerful thought.
- Did I fix the shortfall? Uhhh totally.

ANYWAY, that to say, I get why deferred maintenance happens. (Maybe we should all learn a lesson from [Chris Schwarz’s approach to tool maintenance](https://blog.lostartpress.com/2012/08/04/i-like-to-wipe/), steps 1 and 7: own fewer things you need to maintain.) 

A few links for you:

- [_Dude, where’s my bus?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPaOPAguLxg) is a delightfully researched documentary into the recent-ish history of OC Transpo, pondering why we’re at the poor state of service we are. Some of the comments are also quite detailed—worth a read in addition to a watch.
- Reading [_Receipt from the Bookshop_](https://katieclapham.substack.com/p/receipt-from-the-bookshop-71) is like putting on a cozy sweater at the end of a work week—especially this time of year. Once a week, a story of a day behind the counter at the bookshop, with all its trials and tribulations. This week’s issue is a special one, worth a read.
- [Rushed drafting _on another bill_ has thrown a key piece of proposed cybersecurity legislation into parliamentary chaos.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cybersecurity-bill-c26-senate-1.7396183) Definitely stressful for those involved (especially with the way Parliament is right now), but also a _tiny_ bit hilarious that legislation can go like this. This is the part of the legislative process nobody can teach in school.
- Okay but speaking of cybersecurity, did you read about the time [a Russian threat actor hacked into various organizations to jump from their networks to their ultimate target’s neighbouring network _via WiFi_](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2024/11/22/the-nearest-neighbor-attack-how-a-russian-apt-weaponized-nearby-wi-fi-networks-for-covert-access/)!?
- [How best to store an event’s time in a database?](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/27/storing-times-for-human-events/) (With a totally appropriate dig at Google Calendar’s baaaaaad timezone UI.)
- [Mandy Brown’s “speculative fiction work/shop”](https://everythingchanges.us/workshop/sf) sounds _so_ great. Even just the description of what it is had ideas going in my head.

I feel like this issue should’ve been more thinky-thinky with a weighty title like “Deferred maintenance”. But, y’know, linky-linky is also good. All the best for the week ahead!
