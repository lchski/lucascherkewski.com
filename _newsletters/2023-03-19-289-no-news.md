Hi there!

It’s been a lovely week travelling with T and friends (hi S and V!), but I’m pretty wiped and don’t have much to say otherwise. (Other than, I was glad to miss the news this week, it seems to have been pretty wack??) I’ll spare you the trip highlights, but suffice to say, it’s nice to get away to a different (head)space now and again. And especially to do that with T and good friends. 

I’ve also got some personal things going on that may shorten these over the next few months—we’ll see what emerges. I hope you’ve had a good week, with some happy moments at the least, and wish you all the best for the week ahead. 

Lucas
