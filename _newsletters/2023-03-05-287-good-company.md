Hello!

It’s been a lovely day, hosting S and V for brunch ([Dutch babies](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-a-dutch-baby-pancake-227629) are the best!), followed by time in the sun and springlike weather. Yes, there’ll be more snow and ice—and slush, loads of slush—to come, but we’ll enjoy the upbeat moments when they come.

Speaking of snow, T and I made a snowwoman yesterday. When we went back today, there was no trace, though it didn’t seem like there was any destruction—more like she’d walked off, on some private adventure. Happy for her!

- [Krista Tippett recently interviewed Nick Offerman](https://onbeing.org/programs/nick-offerman-working-with-wood-and-the-meaning-of-life/), and what an interview it was. [Debbie Millman’s interview with him is also excellent](https://www.designmattersmedia.com/podcast/2021/Nick-Offerman)—he brings a joyful humility and self-ease, a personality that’s lovely to spend time with.
- That reminds me of when [Debbie Millman and Roxane Gay were interviewed by Brené Brown about their relationship](https://brenebrown.com/podcast/brene-with-roxane-gay-and-debbie-millman-on-love-life-and-the-pursuit-of-creative-space/), the infectiousness of their joy and love for each other. [Gay recently wrote about a trip she and Millman took to Antarctica](https://www.afar.com/magazine/roxane-gay-and-debbie-millmans-honeymoon-sail-to-antarctica), with characteristic understated hilarity. She has a paragraph contrasting her and Millman’s approaches to travel, and T is very much my Debbie Millman in this respect—for which I’m glad. (And I’d be remiss if I didn’t re-surface [the most excellent of ongoing Antarctica blogs, brr.fyi](https://brr.fyi/), with its delightful focus on infrastructure.)
- I’m enjoying [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/@lchski) for data visualization and interaction. A few weeks ago, I shared [a post by Ben Schmidt on the possibilities for web visualization](https://benschmidt.org/post/2020-01-15/2020-01-15-webgpu/)—fittingly, it’s [through many of his public notebooks](https://observablehq.com/@bmschmidt) that I’ve learned about and explored Observable.
- Finally, [thank you to Sameer for sharing his reflections on turning forty-one](https://www.inthemargins.ca/forty-one). Plenty to quietly chew on when pondering the year ahead. (Don’t miss out on the poem and many links Sameer shares—always worth spending time with his newsletter.)

All the best for the week ahead!
