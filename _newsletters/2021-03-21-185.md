(on the shootings this week in Atlanta—feel free to skip ahead to the next section if your head’s not in the right space for that)

We’re over a year into what has supposedly been momentous change after momentous change. In the most terrible of ways, though, little has changed—or, if it has, it’s worsened.



On the Atlanta shootings, Timothy Yu has gathered a long list of pieces to help think—and feel—through it all: https://twitter.com/timpanyu/status/1373310557441376257

In Canada, too:

Julie S. Lalonde is offering free bystander intervention training. (Having long admired Lalonde’s work, I reckon it’ll be worth your while.) https://twitter.com/JulieSLalonde/status/1372230580901920769

Mita Williams shared the [“Imagining Feminist Futures After COVID-19” toolkit](https://iwda.org.au/feminist-futures/) in [her newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/UniversityOfWinds) yesterday 

> This has been a difficult couple of weeks for those who pay attention to the lives of women. From the murder of Sarah Everard by a police officer to the police brutality laid against women at the vigil held for her. From the rise of hate crimes against Asian elders in Canada and the US to the murder of eight Asian-American women in Atlanta. From the one year anniversary of the murder of Breonna Taylor by police officers to the release of a data from my local police service that confirms that they use a disproportionate amount of force towards visible minorities. Over the last two weeks, I have read a lot of words of sympathy and outrage but nothing from the white men in my circles or in leadership positions pledging to take any action towards change.
