today a day of massive editing! (how many words over)/2500 for HIS2326
but love the process: writing too much and then figuring out what to cut tells
you a lot about your arguments
(I guess it’d be easier to think it out further in advance, but sometimes I find
I’m not really thinking until I’m drafting)
