Hello!

Earlier this year, I promised myself I’d do three things each morning. One of them was to “look up”. Literally, this referred to raising my eyes from the ground, directing them up and around instead. Figuratively, this referred to finding a good reason to go about each day.

Thanks to the former interpretation, I’ve been spending much more time paying attention to birds lately. I’ve long had a casual interest, but now I find myself identifying and recording the birds I see while out walking. (Though I’m hardly comprehensive in my observations.)

Paying more attention to birds has slowed me down. I used to always walk onward, quickly. Now, when there’s a particularly interesting bird around, I’ll slow or stop my walking. Sometimes I’ll retrace my steps to follow it. Watching birds has encouraged me to drop out of life’s slipstream, to stop and stand in wonder.

It’s also deepened my appreciation for local, natural histories that usually pass unnoticed. For example, [last December I saw a hawk take down a pigeon](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/meanwhile-the-world-goes-on/). Returning to that spot on Friday night, I found what seemed to be the pigeon’s feathers, uncovered after the melt. Watching birds attunes me to a host of stories that carry on in their own way, humbling me.

Anyhow, my brain is slow today and my body just wants to be outside. So off I go. All the best for the week ahead!
