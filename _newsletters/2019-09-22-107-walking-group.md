Hello there,

My parents have been part of [a Waterloo walking group](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/90-walking-toward-a-social-summer/) for almost 6 years; the group’s been around for at least 12. Every Saturday morning, folks meet up in downtown Waterloo, walk for an hour or two, then convene at a local cafe for coffee, food, and conversation. It’s something I always look forward to when I return home.

It’s also the type of casual social space that I’ve been missing in Ottawa. A few weeks ago, a friend and I were having lunch, during which I described this group to her. She kindly offered to try to set up something similar here; she’d reach out to folks if I’d put together a route.

Yesterday was our first go at the walk. I was apprehensive beforehand, but grateful once we got going. There’s something about walking that lowers the barrier to entry for a social situation—there’s always something interesting at hand if conversation quiets, and silence is more easily tolerated while walking. (Not that silence needs to be “tolerated”—it’s great!)

I think there are a few key principles behind a group like this:

- It’s a drop in social space. There’s not necessarily a set agenda, other than walking alongside other people. You may know them, you may not—regardless, it’s a chance to talk as you go.
- It grows primarily through invitation. Natural social networks are great frames on which to build a community. While being generally welcoming, having folks invite friends or acquaintances who they think would enjoy the space grows a group organically. It connects people who could be great friends but, for whatever reason, haven’t yet encountered each other.
- It’s regular. You can be more or less assured that it’ll happen at a regular interval—the size and composition of the group may change, but it’s there if you want to go.
