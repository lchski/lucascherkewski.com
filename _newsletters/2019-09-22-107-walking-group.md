Hello there,

My parents have been part of [a Waterloo walking group](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/90-walking-toward-a-social-summer/) for almost 6 years; the group’s been around for at least 12. Every Saturday morning, folks meet up in downtown Waterloo, walk for an hour or two, then convene at a local cafe for coffee, food, and conversation. It’s something I always look forward to when I return home.

It’s also the type of casual social space that I’ve been missing in Ottawa. A few weeks ago, a friend and I were having lunch, during which I described this group to her. She kindly offered to try to set up something similar here; she’d invite folks and we’d try out a walk.

Yesterday was our first go. I was apprehensive beforehand, but grateful once we got going. There’s something about walking that lowers the barrier to entry for a social situation—there’s always something interesting at hand if conversation quiets, and silence is more easily tolerated while walking. (Not that silence needs to be “tolerated”—it’s great!)

I think there are a few key principles behind a group like this:

- It’s a drop-in social space. There’s not necessarily a set agenda, other than walking alongside other people. You may know them, you may not—regardless, it’s a chance to talk as you go.
- It grows primarily through invitation. Natural social networks are great frames on which to build a community. While being generally welcoming, having folks invite friends or acquaintances who they think would enjoy the space grows a group organically. It connects people who could be great friends but, for whatever reason, haven’t yet encountered each other.
- It’s regular. You can be more or less assured that it’ll happen at a regular interval—the size and composition of the group may change, but it’s there if you want to go.

Spaces like these can be hard to come across. They’re sustainable, low-/no-cost, social spaces. It’ll be interesting to track how this one goes—whether it moves from a nice experience to a more regular space.

If you’re in Ottawa and interested in being added to the list, just let me know. In the meantime, all the best for the week ahead—may it be filled, ever and always, with walking and talking.
