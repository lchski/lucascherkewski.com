Five years ago (ish—this is right by the calendar, though issue 260 would’ve been right if we say there are 52 weeks in a year—math with time is hard), I started writing and sending this newsletter.

[The first issue, “Earthworming”, was long.](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/1-earthworming/) It was—also quite personal? And I used headings!? Anyway, it was great. (I also had a [dateline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline), as “location bylines” are apparently called. I kept that for five issues—why’d I get rid of it??)

It was intended, really, to update friends and family on what I was up to, what I was reading and thinking. I originally chose the title “Hit and Miss” _not_ to describe the newsletter’s variety of topics, but for my anticipated schedule: I never expected to be able to stick to a weekly publishing rhythm. 262 weeks later, here we are. I’ve been counselled recently to give myself more credit, to celebrate wins where I have them—hoorah for that one, then!

- top pieces?
- topic modelling?
- THANKS!!!
