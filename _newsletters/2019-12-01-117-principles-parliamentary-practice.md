It’s the start of December! While that carries with it bits of stress for various reasons, we’re* lucky this year because it also marks the start of a new parliamentary session.

(*“we” in this sentence means “I, and others with an inexplicable love for parliamentary institutions.”)

This Thursday, December 5, the 43rd Canadian Parliament will convene itself here in Ottawa. It’ll be the first sitting day in the House of Commons for the MPs elected back in October, the day marking resumption of Senate activities, and the Governor General’s opportunity to deliver a Speech from the Throne. ([Our Parliament, technically, has three parts](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-2.html#s-17): the Queen/her representative the Governor General, the Senate, and the House of Commons.)

While many parliamentary activities are laden with tradition, the opening of a new session is particularly so. The House of Commons’ _Procedure and Practice_ [lays out in some detail how Thursday will play out](https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/ProcedureAndPractice3rdEdition/ch_08_2-e.html). Sometimes the traditions seem silly, but if we dig into _why_ these practices exist, we can learn from the principles behind them.
