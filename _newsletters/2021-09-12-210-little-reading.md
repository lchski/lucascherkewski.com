Hello!

It’s been a quiet vacation week for me. It included a visit with a friend to Laurel Creek Conservation Area ([a history of which I wrote up a few years ago](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/63-laurel-creek-conservation-area/)), a _Star Trek_ marathon, a few election debates, and some family visits. (Writing that out, it sounds less quiet than it felt!)

I didn’t read much, other than the paper, but I did return to a [Shannon Proudfoot article from earlier this year on the role of consultants in the federal government](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/whos-really-got-ottawas-ear/). Proudfoot presents a great summary of the issue, nuancing it with figures and insider opinion.

Anyhow, I’m off to a book club to discuss [_The Buried Giant_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25937759-the-buried-giant)—this group has kept me reading books this year, for which I’m grateful.

All the best for the week ahead!

Lucas
