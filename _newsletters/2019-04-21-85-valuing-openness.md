Hello!

Openness is a value. It’s also a practice.

[“Make things open: it makes things better”](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better) is an attractive slogan; in its seductive simplicity, it’s easy to overlook that this is a statement of values, one that not everybody accepts. But I can comfortable say that it’s a statement I accept.

Here are three episodes from my last few weeks that highlight the value/valuing of openness from different angles:

1. 	On Wednesday, I presented at uOttawa’s Digital History Open House. I shared [my throne speeches topic modelling project](https://his3305.labs.lucascherkewski.com) ([previously discussed in this newsletter](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/67-throne-speeches-thinking-tools/)). Most of the student projects came from coursework. Unfortunately, as an undergraduate you rarely see the work of your fellow students. Any project you work on is usually shared only between you and your professor.
	
	There are a few reasons for this:
	
	- Secrecy makes plagiarism harder (maybe)
	- It’s hard enough to teach students how to write, let alone how to publish or share that information online
	- Students might be uncomfortable with sharing their work
	- Sharing usually isn’t necessary to achieve a course’s learning objective

	Some of these reasons are better than others.

- City of Ottawa 311 app open source or no
	- forget that open is a value, that it reflects a certain view of the world, one not everybody shares (or, some people Arne’t incentivized to share it)
	- open source in government—it's paid for by the public, don't forget
- having hard conversations at work—trusting that your colleagues (and managers) are willing to consider what you have to say, even (especially?) when it’s critical of them or the organization
