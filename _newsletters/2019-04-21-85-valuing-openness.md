Hello!

Openness is a value. It’s also a practice.

[“Make things open: it makes things better”](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better) is an attractive slogan; in its seductive simplicity, it’s easy to overlook that this is a statement of values, one that not everybody accepts. But I can comfortable say that it’s a statement I accept.

Here are three episodes from my last few weeks that highlight the value/valuing of openness from different angles:

1. 	On Wednesday, I presented at uOttawa’s Digital History Open House. I shared [my throne speeches topic modelling project](https://his3305.labs.lucascherkewski.com) ([previously discussed in this newsletter](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/67-throne-speeches-thinking-tools/)). Most of the student projects came from coursework. Unfortunately, as an undergraduate you rarely see the work of your fellow students. Any project you work on is usually shared only between you and your professor.
	
	There are a few reasons for this:
	
	- Secrecy makes plagiarism harder (maybe)
	- It’s hard enough to teach students how to write, let alone how to publish or share that information online
	- Students might be uncomfortable with sharing their work
	- Sharing usually isn’t necessary to achieve a course’s learning objective

	Some of these reasons are better than others. In any case, I’ve found it quite rewarding each time I’ve shared schoolwork in the open. Though I don’t expect anybody to read my projects shared online, knowing that there _could_ be an audience larger than just my prof pushes me to better them. (Admittedly, I could share many more of my projects online than I do—the cost/benefit tradeoff usually tends toward costing. One of the approaches that seems to benefit more than it costs is to [post notes online, as my friend Sean did](http://homepage.usask.ca/~svb702/), though I take my notes on paper.) I think openness in schooling could be a rewarding path.

2. A few weeks ago, [the City of Ottawa presented to Ottawa Civic Tech on their digital services progress](https://www.meetup.com/YOW_CT/events/259734814/). They shared their [new open data portal](https://open.ottawa.ca). They also spoke about a 311 app. The data and services it consumes are all open. Unfortunately, it’s not open source itself. This is something of an openness mismatch—I tend to think that if it’s been paid for with public funds, it should be released publicly. (But folks from the city have seemed, uh, open to the idea of open sourcing—these things can take time.)

3. On a few occasions in the last few months, I’ve had some honest conversations at work. These can be hard. Nothing concerning—it’s healthy to have honest conversations. Indeed, it’s healthy to be _able_ to have honest conversations at work, even if they’re hard. It reflects a trust in colleagues (and managers), a trust that they’re willing to consider what you have to say, even when it’s critical. This is another sense of “open” to hold on to—being honest and willing to converse.

These three episodes illuminate different senses of openness. It’s easy to forget that openness is a value, one not always held by others. I’ve found reward in embracing each of these different senses—perhaps you do, too. In any case, all the best for the week ahead!
