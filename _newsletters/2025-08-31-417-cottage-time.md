<p>There’s a different pace at a cottage, time and energy moving in their own way. Stay up until 1, staring into the fire? Sure. Breakfast at noon, lunch at 5, dinner at whatever delayed hour you grow hungry again? Sure. Ready to hit the water, ready to sleep, ready to whatever? Sure, sure to all of it.</p><p>It’s fall-like again, a time of transition, for reflection both on what’s been and what’s to come. We never know exactly what’s to come, though—more what could be. The same, maybe, is true of the past: through reflection we might realize that what we thought of our own past wasn’t quite right, that there were lessons then for which we’re only ready to be students now.</p><p>Cottage time, helpfully, makes space both for reflection and for being—I’ve spent a few enjoyable hours each morning carving a spoon, focused just on the effect of each stroke of the knife, getting to know the wood, negotiating between my vision for the result and what the constraints of the material will allow. It’s also been fun to share this time with the visiting family of a friend, trying to make a memorable experience in a low-key, low pressure way. But it’s also been a different weekend than years past, with T home to keep an eye on Arthur, something we’re hoping we can ease back out of soon (knock on wood, and thank you, T, for supporting this getaway).</p><p>Anyhow, there haven’t been many links this week, and they’re mostly on my laptop, which is mercifully far from me today. I’ll just leave you with this accidental photo of a hummingbird—all the best for the week ahead.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/65894fee-2b25-4fa8-9ee6-4807daaf88ef.jpeg?w=960&amp;fit=max" draggable="false"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Lucas</p>
