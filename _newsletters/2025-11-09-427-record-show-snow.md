Hello!

I had a reflection on planning and flexibility in mind for today, but the day got away from me. In the spirit of flexibility, we’ll settle for some links:

- Stumbled, as I do every few years, on [Environment and Climate Change Canada’s bulk data download documentation](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/climate/Get_More_Data_Plus_de_donnees/). Got there by searching a location in [ECCC’s Historical Data interface](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html) and clicking an innocuous “Get More Data” link below “Download Data”. Sometimes, truly, all a website needs to be is a file directory.
- The federal budget came out this week. I have… no comment? But: I strongly recommend [Viet Vu’s tips on how to read a budget](https://dais.ca/commentary/how-to-read-a-budget/)—they’re not the straightforward financial statements the word “budget” might evoke.
- Why can’t we have “nice” apartment buildings in Canada, for a European definition of “nice”? Rules _and finances_ make [these buildings harder to build](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/gift/27602ea8006269cbbc1c17fb5cd3e556fdc5449a87027a1be993352938c26c9b/NZGFJ3JMOVBRPBYWALUGF4R3Y4/).
- I love when a post’s title so perfectly title captures its essence: “[Outside sad is better than inside sad](https://anniemueller.com/posts/outside-sad-is-better-than-inside-sad)”.
- Watched _Sully_ while visiting with my parents last night. Great portrayal of an incident response and the reflection that ought to follow after. Most interesting to me was the tension between human knowledge (and experience) and what the data seems to show.
- Turns out [“time immemorial” has a definition](https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/time-immemorial-turns-750-the-medieval-law-that-froze-history-at-1189-84893/): September 3rd, 1189.

All the best for the week ahead!
