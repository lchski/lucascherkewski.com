last week 26th edition, let it pass
wary about commemoration
opinion on birthdays
renaming monuments/buildings isn't erasing history: history books preserve those
previous names, allow us to grapple with our past while moving forward in a
meaningful way (if the only reason you remember someone is because their name
is on a building, what does that say about that person?)
