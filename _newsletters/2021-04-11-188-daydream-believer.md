I spent much of yesterday afternoon lazing about, basking in the sun and feeling a cool breeze waft over me. Reading, puzzles, radio—none of them were doing it for me yesterday, but quiet pondering was.

Later, I did one of my regular routes in and around Parliament Hill. Construction continues apace—I took in the many big holes and funky structures going up. The “temporary” construction infrastructure looks so _permanent_—[maybe that’s to be expected for a massive 10+ year project](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/an-elaborate-sequence-of-projects-in-restoration-of-parliament-hills-historic-centre-block).

Big things take time—including quiet downtime, now and again.

- Justin Ling, continuing to report on public technology and its impacts on handling the pandemic, [explored Canada’s fragmented systems for infectious disease tracking](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-public-health-data-meltdown/). (Or [maybe there is no “Canada”](https://twitter.com/ldobsonhughes/status/1379821337355681792).)
- Bianca Wylie, continuing to advance important conversations on public technology governance, [on the democratic risks of Canadian governments’ longstanding practice of outsourcing technology](https://biancawylie.medium.com/digital-rights-government-it-and-public-service-ethics-78b7e97bf127).
- A great TikTok of when [“an awesome grandma comes bopping by”, dancing to her own beat](https://www.tiktok.com/@omgitslindz/video/6948514752310070534). (Sidenote: when that video was shared with me, the amount of metadata in the URL was enormous! *shakes fist at data-obsessed web* Cleaned it up for ya.)

All the best for the week ahead!
