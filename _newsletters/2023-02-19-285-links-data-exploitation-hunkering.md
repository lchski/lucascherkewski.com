Hello!

I’ve spent much of the weekend working on an exciting data-y side project. Been having fun learning about graph theory (just enough learning, that is, to torque the numbers I need from a graph) and pondering organizational structures. Awesome as that is, it’s seriously thrown off my adherence to the “best rest is no screen” principle, so, here we are, me [a bit drained and various things still to do today](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-work-is-not-enough).

So, then, some links!

- Speaking of graphs, [the Open Syllabus Galaxy is a fascinating interactive visualization of relationships between different assigned readings in syllabi](https://galaxy.opensyllabus.org/). And it’s [accompanied by a detailed write-up of its data structure and creation](https://blog.opensyllabus.org/galaxy-v2/)—not sure which I love more!
- That led me (through a few clicks) to a reflection from a few years ago by [Ben Schmidt on the evolution of different tools in the “data programming” landscape, and the increasing prominence of JavaScript](https://benschmidt.org/post/2020-01-15/2020-01-15-webgpu/)—which is only truer today. As someone wrestling with how best to publicly visualize a large-ish dataset, lots to chew on here.
- [Anne Helen Petersen on how exploitation and precarity are so increasingly common.](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/is-everything-an-mlm-33f)
- [Mandy Brown, in a similar theme, on how relationships can—should!—outlast working together.](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/your-work-is-bigger-than-this-one-time-and-place/)
- Apparently [the 15-minute city concept has become a conspiracy theory about freedom of movement](https://theconversation.com/15-minute-cities-how-to-separate-the-reality-from-the-conspiracy-theory-200111) and I just really worry about the ability to have substantive policy conversations these days.
- Finally, [the intrepid Antarctic blogger at brr.fyi has hunkered down for winter, sharing the details on how the base prepares for a long wait](https://brr.fyi/posts/last-flight-out).

All the best for the week ahead!
