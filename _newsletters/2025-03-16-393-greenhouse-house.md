Hullo!

We’re on the road this week, so will keep it short with some links:

- If you want a garden and greenery all year round, but live in a cold climate, apparently you can [build your house in a greenhouse](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/mar/09/outside-in-the-extraordinary-home-inside-a-giant-greenhouse-in-norway)!?
- Vanessa Guerrero, reposted by Jason Kottke, on the positive effects of [eyes on the street, thanks to a taco truck](https://kottke.org/25/03/eyes-on-the-street) (love the idea that this made waiting at the bus stop more sociable, more _fun_).
- [Kevin Kelly’s travel tips](https://kk.org/thetechnium/50-years-of-travel-tips/) have a lot to commend. But, I wonder, as I see families travelling around us: what’d be Kelly’s tips for travelling with young kids?
- [_Walking as Research Practice_](https://www.schweizerkulturpreise.ch/awards/en/home/ssb/ssb-archiv/ssb-2023/ssb-2023/walking-as-research-practice.html) is a beautiful, experimental publication with various contributions on walking. Of course the subject matter appeals to me, but the _design_ was what drew me in. Delightful to hold in your hand.

All the best for the week ahead!
