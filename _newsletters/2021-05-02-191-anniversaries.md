- coming up on one-year anniversary of learning of S's death (https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/140-in-memorian/)
- May 1 is the three-year anniversary of my joining CDS
	- one of the last conversations I had with S, ties in well
	- wanted to go to Toronto to visit some family
	- knew he could take the GO Train, but didn't want to use one of the ticket machines—didn't trust it, didn't know how to work it, all of the above
	- also didn't know how to get the schedules—didn't have or use a computer at home, didn't care to
	- and so he simply didn't.
	- good services meet people where they are, accounting for the barriers they face and giving them the confidence to access the service that gets them on their way
	- grateful to be able to continue trying to realize that vision through my work at CDS
