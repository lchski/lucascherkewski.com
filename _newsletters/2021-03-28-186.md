Hello!

It’s a drizzly day here in O-town. I think the afternoon’ll consist of flopping on the couch, reading the paper, maybe playing some video games—aiming high, in other words. I’ve been 3D modelling my furniture in anticipation of moving to a new apartment (much more fun than actually _doing_ the moving), so that’ll probably fill some time, too.

Anyway, three links for today:

- Following on some of the pieces I shared [last week](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/185-spring-change-or-not/), here’s an excellent one from Victoria Chan (a great co-worker with a penchant for the pen): “[Anti-Asian Hate Is Skyrocketing in Canada. Here's How Communities Can Fight Back.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dp7d3/anti-asian-hate-is-skyrocketing-in-canada-heres-how-communities-can-fight-back)”
- On [an Orillia bowling alley’s attempts to make it work during COVID](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/bowling-alley-pandemic-shutdowns-1.5965503). I’ve walked by my local alley a few times in the last few weeks—gosh, I miss bowling. Such a low-key yet rewarding activity, wonderful solo or socially.
- The [Louvre collections database has hundreds of thousands of works online, many with detailed digital images](https://collections.louvre.fr/en/). I also like the structured data-ness of the tool: “Search results can also be exported as a flat file (CSV). Each entry has its own URL based on the ARK identification protocol to guarantee uniqueness and durability. The permalink is located at the bottom of each entry. The site allows users to download texts about the artwork in JSON format.”

All the best for the week ahead!
