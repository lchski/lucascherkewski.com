Hello!

Having a lovely cosy morning, after a lovely cosy day, which leaves me in more of a reading mood than a writing one. And that’s great! Rest, rest, rest, needs to be the rule of the day more often than it is.

Just really briefly, then, some links (for your reading, if you’d like)!

- “[Put your name on it](https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/put-your-name-on-it/)” by Lynn Fisher
- “[Why governors put this over here, with the rest of the fire](https://waldo.jaquith.org/blog/2023/02/governors-double-down/)” by Waldo Jaquith
- “[Researchers working on First Nations claims say Ottawa has made accessing archival records more difficult](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-first-nations-archival-records-federal-government/)” by Patrick White
- “[My Lifelong Quest for Silence](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/my-lifelong-quest-for-silence)” by Ted Gioia

Also, last night we watched [_We Have a Ghost_](https://letterboxd.com/film/we-have-a-ghost/), a very 2023 movie. Didn’t knock our socks off, but had a bit of fun to it.

All the best for the week ahead!
