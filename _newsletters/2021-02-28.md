It was a morning of hoar frost and slowly clearing fog, a perfect scene setter for my riverside ramble. The birds are on their way back, slowly—the weeks ahead will yield wonders aplenty.

They’re also certain to yield pandemiversaries aplenty. That’ll be interesting. Our outward lives amputated, our inward lives slowed, it sometimes feels like all that’s left is to dwell. But let’s set that aside for now.

A few fun links from this week:

- [Ottawa’s making moves on a new infill housing development, with heavy emphasis on affordable housing.](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/city-grabbing-federal-land-near-little-italy-to-complete-land-assembly-for-major-infill-community/wcm/82656297-5ca0-4e65-a83b-1393d0854218/) While there’ll no doubt be some fuss raised, at least no one can credibly claim that the federal parking lot at the district’s north end is “[the heart of the community](https://globalnews.ca/news/7666729/east-york-cedarvale-avenue-affordable-modular-housing-conflict/)”.
- Stanley Tucci is making the rounds, thanks to his various TV shows, movies, books, and so on. [A recent L.A. Times interview with Tucci offers some entertaining stories.](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-02-18/stanley-tucci-searching-for-italy-supernova-negroni-cocktail)
- [This week was the Toronto Data Workshop’s _Workshop on Reproducibility_ event.](https://rohanalexander.com/reproducibility.html) It was a low-key, high-value affair, full of engaging speakers sharing their philosophies and projects. I particularly appreciated that it was livestreamed via YouTube, making it easy to catch up later. The session recordings are all already linked from the conference page—a good one to come back to, now and again.
- [This comprehensive “who’s invited to the _Star Trek_ cookout” thread is truly a delight.](https://twitter.com/starklyjd/status/1366036311820406785) There are some _deep cuts_ in there, too, absolutely nerdy references. I love it.

All the best for the week ahead! Soak in the sun if it’s peeking out.
