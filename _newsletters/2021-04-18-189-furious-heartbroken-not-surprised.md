Hello!

Well, it‚Äôs been quite a few days, hasn‚Äôt it? There‚Äôs been a lot of gloom. But today my family gathered on Zoom today to wish my Nonna happy birthday (twenty people across ten devices)‚Äîthat was a highlight, for sure.

Okay, now to the gloom, briefly‚Äîif only to note it for our future selves.

Ontario legalized arbitrary police questioning and banned playgrounds (among other outdoor amenities). It [undid the policing changes](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-police-random-spot-checks-1.5991872) and [reopened playgrounds, while keeping most other outdoor recreation shut down](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-restrictions-what-you-can-what-you-cannot-do-1.5991941). It _didn‚Äôt_ do much to help workers in congregate work settings, and, [despite its claims that it‚Äôs expanding ICU capacity, it likely won‚Äôt have the people to adequately staff those beds](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1884162627753). (On those last fronts: it‚Äôs never too late to phone or write in favour of protections for the most vulnerable, most essential.)

I‚Äôll save you my COVID anxiety spiral, on ICUs, car crashes, overtaxed contact tracing systems, and so on. Friday, after _waves hands at the above_, I took [a woozy walk](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/woozy-walk/) with [Jos√© Gonz√°lez‚Äôs cover of ‚ÄúThis Is How We Walk On The Moon‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rByhODV9M2w). It helped, as such walks often do.

A few interesting pieces:

- Justin Ling wrote [a sharp piece on Canada‚Äôs COVID-19 situation, ‚ÄúHow did it come to this?‚Äù](https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/how-did-it-come-to-this/) The numerous links to solid, evidence-backed stories are wonderful.
- [Accounting firms are audited for their audits, but the results are confidential??](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-canadas-accounting-firm-problem-child-remains-a-mystery/) This makes absolutely no sense, and only increases my ü§® feeling about accounting and audit firms. (Especially certain big ones.)
- Turns out comical corruption still happens. [Replete with stereotypical Italian details, the ‚ÄúBondfield files‚Äù are quite a read.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-the-secret-bondfield-files-records-outline-alleged-kickbacks-between/)

I also want to share [the Black Alert podcast](https://twitter.com/BlackAlertPod). It‚Äôs a knowledgeable, engaged group of Black Trek fans, reviewing episodes and discussing Trek through their own perspectives. Fantastic. (You can find it wherever you get your podcasts, or [on Simplecast](https://black-alert-podcast.simplecast.com/).)

All the best for the week ahead, friends. Hang in there.
