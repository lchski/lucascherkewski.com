Hello!

Spent thirty minutes picking tomatoes in the dense backyard jungle of plants, looking carefully for all the red ones. Then, having exhausted one spot, I’d move a step over to another—only to see several in the previous spot that I’d missed. Oh, the power of a change in perspective.

Plenty of links today, vaguely grouped—hence, bits and bobs.

Today marks eight years since [_Hit and Miss_ issue #1](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/1-earthworming/), if we count it “the second Sunday in September” as the _Hit and Miss_ birthdate. Turning eight gives this child no extra legal privileges I’m aware of, but it’s getting to that age where you can leave it unsupervised for longer periods, give it time to explore its interests, and then hear it excitedly discuss them later.

Being the excellent people you all are, I’m grateful to you for continuing to indulge this meandering child as it grows into whatever person it’ll be—and whatever person I’ll be, getting to parent it from week to week.

Speaking of parenting, this delightful [_On Being_ conversation with Sylvia Boorstein](https://onbeing.org/programs/sylvia-boorstein-what-we-nurture-2022/) is nominally about parenting, but really about how caring for and being kind to ourselves sets an example for children around us to grow into.

While weeding yesterday, listening to an unending queue of podcasts, an ad from KitKat came on, saying something like “Canadians are being too polite to AI and using a lot of energy. So take a break from saying ‘sorry’, ‘please’, and ‘thank you’ to AI to save energy.“ This is a real ad I heard from KitKat!

I looked it up, and this seems to be [a new KitKat ad campaign](https://adage.com/creativity/work/aa-kitkat-have-a-break-from-ai-politeness/). “Have a break from AI politeness, it’s not worth the energy” is a thing that a chocolate bar company is making ads to tell me??

This is, incidentally, [not the first time KitKat got looped into the AI scene](https://kitkathaveaibreak.ca/).

Any highlights in that unending stream of podcast episodes? I’m glad you asked:

- [Episode 420 of _Ben Franklin’s World_](https://benfranklinsworld.com/episode-420-peter-kastor-creating-the-u-s-federal-government/), interviewing Peter Kastor about his project [_Creating a Federal Government, 1789–1827_](https://creatingafederalgovernment.wustl.edu/). If the title of that project alone isn’t enough to see why I was excited about it, get this: it’s a database, manually transcribed from numerous primary sources, of nearly every U.S. federal employee in the first almost four decades of the U.S. government’s existence.[^havetocountit] SO MUCH GREAT STUFF IN THIS EPISODE!
- [_Sporkful_ interview with LeVar Burton](https://www.sporkful.com/levar-burton-even-reads-recipes-dramatically-copy/), including stories of stolen steaks and how hard it is to eat when you have a VISOR on.
- Another _Sporkful_ episode, this one on [how Michelin stars are awarded](https://www.sporkful.com/how-do-michelin-stars-actually-work/). (Including a guest appearance of Accenture consulting advice on how to make Michelin more profitable, looooool.)

[^havetocountit]: The origin story for this database is the same as maybe all of my data projects: well, I want to know how big a thing was over time (in this case, “how big was the U.S. government, and where was it located?”); there don’t seem to be any comprehensive answers to that question available, so I think I’ll just start gathering the data; hmm, I’ve gotten some data here, but I can’t answer the question decisively just yet… I’m going to need _all_ the data. This last step (hurdle?) also why many of my data projects don’t see the light of day. Oops!

Final bits and/or bobs:

- [Robin Rendle’s reflections on _Poverty, By America_](https://robinrendle.com/notes/notes-on-poverty/) use his personal experience with poverty to illustrate the book’s central themes—really good.
- [Anne Trubek’s _Notes from a Small Press_](https://notesfromasmallpress.substack.com/) is one of my long-time favourite newsletters, offering a window into the publishing industry. Trubek recently wrote about how to read more, specifically [how to read more _for pleasure_](https://notesfromasmallpress.substack.com/p/how-to-read-more).
- [Lean](https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/) is a programming language for math proofs, that can then actually verify those proofs. Imagining how all the parts of a proof would read in Lean brings to mind that [much of `jq`’s standard library is itself written in `jq`](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/blob/master/src/builtin.jq). Anyway, I’m very glad other people are into math like this—I will happily benefit from your enthusiasm!! (via SB)
- Question and answers about [life with a “dumbphone”](https://blog.avas.space/dumbphone-wife/).

It’s in the footer every week, but I mean it every time—thank you, so much, for reading along. In eight more years, this thing’ll be driving itself—whew!

All the best for the week ahead.
