Hey! The words are just not coming this week—it’s been a bit of a doozy. Some links, then:

- Glad to see the provincial government’s embrace of [evidence-based decision-making when deciding to remove speed cameras](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-premier-announcement-speed-cams-live-1.7643182). Ha!
- In a more optimistic turn, [Montfort Hospital’s mental health waiting room](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/whitecoat/montfort-hospital-mental-health-emergency-zone-1.7643240) sounds like a real win. Congratulations (and thank you, as a thankfully infrequent patient of Montfort) to all involved.
- A delightful parking cop tracker for San Francisco quickly lost access to its data after launching, but the [technique for scraping the data](https://walzr.com/sf-parking/about/) remains available for others to learn from. (via Andy Baio)
- I haven’t quite the confidence to leave behind smartphones (mostly because I prefer my text-based communication to occur via WhatsApp / Signal, and enjoy having an excellent camera with me), but this account of [one week with the Light Phone](https://antonesvillagegreen.substack.com/p/one-week-of-freedom) does have me wondering how deeply suffering I am as a result.
- Allan Downey’s approach of [using code to teach math](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2025/09/22/think-linear-algebra/) (in this case, linear algebra) feels like it would’ve helped me immensely in school. Oh, where might I have gone if I hadn’t tracked myself away from math! (But history was great, too—no regrets, truly.)
- Waldo describes an elegant model for [managing outsourced software development via GitHub](https://waldo.jaquith.org/blog/2025/09/github-pr-model/) (or any other issues-integrated branching version control system). What I appreciate is it forces the code to be _in an actual repository_ (not the case with shocking frequency), and makes crystal clear what the vendor has done (and how that work has been overseen).
- Simon Collison shared his reflections on a grant-funded [summer of sound](https://colly.com/journal/reflecting-on-a-summer-of-sound). (Delightful, as always, to see the tangible and intangible impacts of grants.)
- A newsletter pointing to another newsletter is maybe a condition of the modern indie web, but [the latest _UofWinds_ by Mita Williams](https://www.uofwinds.com/421/) is well worth your time. Each player in this week’s main trio of links was a good read.

Not so bad after all. This newsletter was brought to you by a great decaf coffee, made by T with equipment and beans from T+D. Thanks all. All the best for the week ahead!
