Hello!

Pretty tired today (rainy day, and T and I only realized midafternoon that we’d made half-caff espresso this morning), but hanging in. We’re all curled up in our corners—T on the couch, Arthur on the windowsill, me on the lounger. It’ll be a restful end to a week of good walks and good talks (including a particularly rewarding verbal ramble with [Asad](http://asadchishti.com/)).

Let’s get right into the links:

- [“Six Thousand Years of Forests”, by Sophie Yeo, with sound recordings by Joseph Monkhouse and illustrations by Elin Manon (making a feast for the senses), considers a long history of forests in Britain](https://www.inkcapjournal.co.uk/six-thousand-years-of-forests/)—though much of the change over that history has happened in a relatively short time. Change, faster and faster, but trees still need the time they need (or maybe they’re driven to grow faster, too). ([via Alan Jacobs](https://buttondown.email/ayjay/archive/discovering-the-maize-god/))
- [Will programming move entirely from localhost to cloud dev environments?](https://dx.tips/the-end-of-localhost) Maybe, who knows! An interesting thought experiment anyway.
- Long-time readers will know that I have a pretty straightforward relationship with heat (as in, hot outside air): I dislike it. Not only is cooler weather more comfortable (no sweating!) and more practical (layers! extra pockets!), it’s also safer (to a point, of course). But it’s going to become rarer and rarer as the climate changes—so [researchers are digging into nuanced, practical advice for surviving prolonged heat exposure](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-feeling-the-heat-as-global-temperatures-continue-to-rise-an-ottawa-lab/). Part of the [No Safe Place series, on climate adaptation](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/no-safe-place/)—the kind of writing and research we so desperately need.
- I’ve also been looking to read and support more local news, particularly as the municipal elections gear up. For that, [_Ottawa Lookout_ has been a great source](https://www.ottawalookout.com/)—there’s always one or two tidbits in it that I enjoy reading, and the food recommendations in the subscription version are well worth the price of entry.

All the best for the week ahead!
