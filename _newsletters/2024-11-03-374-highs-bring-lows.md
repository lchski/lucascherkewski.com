…morning? afternoon? evening? The sun is shortly setting!? Post-time-change confusion coupled with post-COVID-booster blehness has made for a drained, tired Sunday. It reinforces how true the whole body-mind connection is: when feeling low, I also _think_ low. In these moments, it’s harder to remember and reflect on what’s good, which can lead to some uncomfortable spiralling.

But today’s lows are coming off a good week, so I’m trying to accept them as the counterpoint to a number of highs. Also, as ever, grateful to take these blooster blahs for a day or two in exchange for better chances in the face of COVID infections. Plus, apparently it’ll be in the low 20s later this week!? Not that I love the macro implications of these unseasonably warm days, but I’ll take little pops of warmth when we can.

- Two big highlights of the good week, different in scale but the same in loveliness: cozying up Tuesday night with T, _You’ve Got Mail_, and some Swiss Chalet takeout—a perfect evening in; going out (to Montreal!) [Thursday night to see the Boss and the band](https://brucespringsteen.net/shows/montreal-qc-october-31-2024-springsteen-e-street-band-tour/) play the theme from _Ghostbusters_ followed by another great show—as ever, if I have half his energy, stamina, and endurance at the age of 75, I’ll be living a very good life.
- Yesterday was a day of many plans, none cancelled, all fulfilled, and it was good—but I definitely get the appeal of this poem, “[The Cancellation](https://katherinemay.substack.com/p/the-bliss-of-cancelled-plans)”.

Two fun (for a, er, particular definition of “fun”) links:

- On the utility and, more importantly, _limits_ of [making and using indices (“made up numbers”)](https://backofmind.substack.com/p/made-up-numbers-are-just-pretend) to convey non-numeric ideas (like “freedom”).
- [Timezones are wack!](https://ssoready.com/blog/engineering/truths-programmers-timezones/)

Ooookay! Tonight, I’ve a hairline fracture to fix in a panel for the ongoing blanket chest project (thankfully, less painful to fix than a hairline fracture in some bone), and maybe some shop shelving to put up. This week, I’ll be at FWD50—if you’re around and see me, say hi! Otherwise, all the best for the week ahead!
