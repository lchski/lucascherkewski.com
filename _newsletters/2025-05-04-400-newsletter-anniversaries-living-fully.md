Well, that‚Äôs a round number. It‚Äôs hard to grok doing something four hundred weeks in a row (though of course there‚Äôs much we do automatically for far longer than that‚Äîeating, cleaning, sleeping, and so on). I hope you get somewhere close to as much out of reading this as I do out of writing it.

This was another weekend, like [that of issue #300](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/300-living-the-principles/), spent nicely [‚Äúliving the principles‚Äù set out in issue #100](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/100-living-principles/): yesterday included reading, workshop time,[^radio] catching up with friends and family alike, and installing a piece ‚Äúon-site‚Äù (aka finally finishing and installing doors for one of the garden bed covers I built‚Ä¶ a year ago); today had more friendship time, plus Moo Shu and getting my hands dirty by fixing a flat on my bike.

[^radio]: My workshop time throughout the weekend was enhanced by music from my Oma‚Äôs old radio and speaker set (itself bought by my dad on a layaway plan in the 70s or 80s). Radio-Canada‚Äôs classical music in the morning, boom 99.7‚Äôs 70s / 80s / 90s in the afternoons.

(Also, if I read issue #300 correctly, yesterday marks 100 weeks of woodworking for me‚Äîneat! I will properly reflect on that another time. But having done woodworking yesterday and very light bike mechanic-ing today, I can say I _much_ prefer the woodworking üòÇ)

It‚Äôs a treat to find and share interesting things with you each week‚Äîthank you for reading, whether for one issue or‚Ä¶ four hundred!?

- I really enjoyed this post from Martha [exploring humility from a number of different angles](https://www.marthaedwards.ca/leading-with-humility/), from how it shows up in leaders (and should affect organizational decisions more!) to how it shapes us personally. Plus a through line about Martha‚Äôs dad that has it all hang together nicely.
- Simon Willison quoted a piece on [DuckDB‚Äôs importance to making geospatial analysis accessible](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/05/03/duckdb-is-the-most-impactful-geospatial-software-in-a-decade.html), and [referenced some other discussion about it](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/4/duckdb-is-probably-the-most-important-geospatial-software-of-the/#atom-everything). The thesis of the article fits me to a T. DuckDB made GIS so much easier for me‚Äîe.g., adding some information to a point when it falls within a particular geometry, it‚Äôs a natural SQL operation that [DuckDB‚Äôs spatial extension](https://duckdb.org/2023/04/28/spatial.html) makes so accessible. (And, hard to emphasize just how incredible it is to have zero dependency fiddling while doing geo work. Amazing!)
- A good reminder from Annie Mueller on [how much people can change in ten years](https://anniemueller.com/posts/people-can-change).
- Speaking of doing mechanical things this weekend, I enjoyed [Simon Collison‚Äôs brief post about fixing an espresso machine](https://colly.com/journal/coffee-fix)‚Äîthe merits of being methodical. (I caught myself in a moment of impatience while putting my tire back on today, cooled my head, thought it through, and worked the problem out. If only I could always catch myself in those moments!)
- Simon‚Äôs also [been journalling about his time at CAMP](https://colly.com/journal/tag:camp%20france), an arts residency in the French Pyrenees. Been very neat to follow along.
- There was an election this week! (Or, really, 343 elections. But we‚Äôll round to one.) So much appreciation to all the poll workers and other staff who work tirelessly to enable people across this vast, varied country to vote. This story of [voting in Canada‚Äôs North](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/gift/27602ea8006269cbbc1c17fb5cd3e556fdc5449a87027a1be993352938c26c9b/OW5AS6U7KZCTBMDAIT6PK7QGOE/) welled up a lot of good feelings in me.

I know it‚Äôs in the footer, and up in today‚Äôs intro‚Äîbut, again, thank you for following along here. It means a lot. All the best for the week ahead!
