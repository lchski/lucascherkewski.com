As I prepared to brush my teeth, I suddenly gasped. T, from the other room, asked what was wrong. “It’s Sunday and I haven’t sent my newsletter yet!”

Oh, time off. I’ve only the vaguest grasp remaining on the days of the week, nearly missing sending this as a result.

In the last or second-last issue of each year, I try to recommend some books I’ve read in the past twelve months. This year, I didn’t read nearly as much—been a bit all over the place, and reading hasn’t been the main way I’ve passed the time.

A few do come to mind, though:

- [_Menewood_](https://nicolagriffith.com/books/menewood-coming-october-3-2023/) by Nicola Griffith: I mentioned it as a “looking forward to this” in [last year’s year-end issue](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/382-some-books-from-2024/), and, dear reader, _I actually followed through_. An excellent sequel to an already beloved book. May just [reread](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/case-for-rereading) them both this year.
- [_Mortise and Tenon_ magazine](https://www.mortiseandtenonmag.com/collections/magazine): Each issue is basically a book, and I’ve been steadily acquiring back issues with articles of particular interest. They’ve been a delight to read, and are really about _craft_—so much more than just woodworking. I especially love the articles by their [research grant](https://www.mortiseandtenonmag.com/pages/grant) recipients, the product of a bit of material support to dive deep into a subject of interest. (Their tenth anniversary “[Issue X](https://www.mortiseandtenonmag.com/collections/magazine/products/tenth-anniversary-issue)” is particularly epic; I recommend it. If in Canada, [Lee Valley has it in stock](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca/shop/tools/books-and-dvds/118427-mortise-tenon-10th-anniversary-special-issue), no need for import duties or expensive shipping.)
- [_Things Become Other Things_](https://craigmod.com/books/things_become_other_things/) by Craig Mod: I didn’t fully _read_ TBOT this year, but have enjoyed reading _about_ it through [Craig’s various newsletters](https://craigmod.com/newsletters/). Craig’s energy and perspective always makes for a good read.
- [_Consolations_](https://davidwhyte.com/store/book/consolations/) by David Whyte: An excellent book of “is it prose or is it poetry” to keep at the bedside.

2025 has been quite a year. Not so sad to see it go, other than how easy math has been with a nice “round” number like 25. 

I’m closing out this last _Hit and Miss_ of the year after a week with loved ones, sitting now in bed with three particularly loved ones close at hand—Pema in my lap, Arthur at my feet, and T at my side. I hope you’ve also had, or are soon to have, some time with loved ones—all the best for the week, and year, ahead!
