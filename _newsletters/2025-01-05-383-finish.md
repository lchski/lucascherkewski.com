Hello!! Yesterday was pretty so-so—irritable all day, like I’d just started it with the wrong mindset (though T’s suggestion of a midday walk did help). Then today was wonderful—started the morning in quiet contemplation, started _and finished_ multiple DIY projects, helped friends (including finishing a project with V that we’d first messaged about in August!?), and puttered.

I think my word for the year will be “finish”. I’ve picked words on and off in recent years, [inspired by Sameer](https://www.inthemargins.ca/choosing-the-right-word) (whose [word for 2024 was “remember”](https://www.inthemargins.ca/word-of-2024-remember)). Chatting with Sean earlier this week, we both reflected on looking for side project time, trying to get things _done_ where and when we can. In woodworking and data alike, I start far more projects than I finish—I’d like to shift that ratio a bit this year. We’ll see!

My contemplative morning reading:

- [Mandy Brown on the infamous “taste gap”](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/stay-in-the-gap/), challenging the idea that we ought ever fully cross or escape the gap
- Alan Jacobs on [Le Guin, Graeber, and anarchism](https://harpers.org/archive/2022/12/between-chaos-and-the-man-the-dawn-of-everything-graeber-wengrow-the-dispossessed-ursula-k-le-guin/) (I mentioned _Loving Corrections_ by adrienne maree brown last week—Ursula K. Le Guin features prominently in an excellent essay early in that book)
- L.M. Sacasas on Lewis Mumford’s phrase that “[Life cannot be delegated](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/life-cannot-be-delegated)”

Then, over lunch, seeking more contemplation, I turned to that great voice in the ear, Krista Tippett. [Maria Popova’s _On Being_ appearance](https://onbeing.org/programs/maria-popova-cartographer-of-meaning-in-a-digital-age-feb2019/) is delightful—and goes perfectly with [Popova’s post from yesterday, “Wherever You Are, Stop What You’re Doing”](https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/01/04/the-comfort-of-crows/).

Also, I listened to Billy Joel a bunch, including _Cold Spring Harbor_.

Finally, I leave you with my Nonno’s words from his voicemail to me this afternoon: “Lucas this is your grandfather. I just want you to know, [tonight is _La bohème_ on the radio](https://classicalfm.ca/shows/sunday-night-at-the-opera/). Okay? Have a nice day, buh-bye!” (Don’t worry, I immediately called back and we chatted about all sorts of things.) All the best for the week ahead!
