Hello! Down visiting family for a few days, always interesting to be back in KW to see what’s changed and what’s charmingly still the same. And, of course, sorting through all the memories that being here dredges up.

But, last week’s unexpected dive into LeBreton meant I’ve built up two weeks worth of links to share! First, a few links on good ol’ humanity:

- The other week, a friend shared some stories about José “Pepe” Mujica, former president of Uruguay who famously continued to live on his farm throughout his presidency. Serendipitously, [Austin Kleon shared a few links about Mujica in his latest newsletter](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/book-truckin)—someone who stayed so grounded and clear on what makes life worth living.
- [Cortney Cassidy’s story of leaving tech for gardening](https://dark.properties/growing-beyond-the-computer/) (and, yes, giving up many material “comforts” to do so!) resonates similarly: someone who’s identified what’s worth working for and what’s not.
- I found Cassidy’s interview through [Jack Cheng’s most recent newsletter](https://www.jackcheng.com/sunday/430-how-bridges-are-built/), which I’d bookmarked simply noting “good one”—a quick reread confirms that. Also found out through this issue that [Jenny Odell has a newsletter](https://buttondown.com/jennitaur/archive/) (!!).
- As news of two hurricanes and their resulting devastation filled the papers in recent weeks, I appreciated [Christopher Brown’s reflections on the antidote to disaster](https://fieldnotes.christopherbrown.com/p/apocalypse-macaroni-and-other-signs): not siloed, individual hoarding, but community.
- James Rebanks (of _The Shepherd’s Life_, _English Pastoral_ aka _Pastoral Song_, and, I’ve just learned, [a new book, _The Place of Tides_](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/13/the-place-of-tides-james-rebanks-review-norway-eider-duck-down)) appears in [a few videos on the _Carbon Cowboys_ (lol) Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/carboncowboys/), celebrating the grass and biomass in his pastures.

Finally, a more eclectic set of links:

- I’ve heard it a few different times and places, but I was really impressed with [the increasingly favourable economics of solar power](https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/solar-economics/) (and also enjoyed the tales of NASA bureaucracy and what government versus startups optimize for).
- [Free your cutting boards of their finishes!!](https://www.finewoodworking.com/2024/10/10/the-best-food-safe-finish-may-be-none-at-all)
- Enjoyed this awesome [data analysis and visualization of fanfic ships](https://pudding.cool/2024/10/fanfic/).
- “[A Syllabus for Generalists](https://syllabusproject.org/a-syllabus-for-generalists/)” by [Cristina Jerney](https://syllabusproject.org/cristina-jerney/) (and the entire [Syllabus Project](https://syllabusproject.org)) is good fun. For me, from the Generalists list, I think I’d like to dive into geometry. ([via Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org/24/10/0045414-a-syllabus-for-generalist))

Turkey time. All the best for the week ahead!
