Good morning!

Thus far, [November is going pretty well, contrary to last week’s expectations](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/217-surviving-november/). It’s been sunny, friendly, lovely—no complaints, really. Spent last night hosting a grilled cheese party with a screening of _Die Hard_. We’re on our way to the holiday season, pals!

I’m off on some exciting adventures today, so I’ll just briefly share some links:

- [Climate science, nuanced definitions of scientific objectivity, and the role of expertise in the public realm—Viviane Fairbank brings it all.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-climate-change-is-a-fact-but-to-prove-it-scientists-are-bogged-down-in/) (I also appreciated the inline fact checking, calling out false statements quoted by others. Awesome.)
- A colleague often pokes fun at me for eating dinner at “grandpa hours”—I’m usually at the table by around 5:30, if I have my act together. Turns out, [there’s something to be said for an early dinner](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-underrated-pleasures-of-eating-dinner-early). Grandpa hours are _great_.
- As a frequent observer of the construction underway on Parliament Hill, [it’s fascinating to me to read about the UK’s seeming inability to launch a similar comprehensive project](https://thehistoryofparliament.wordpress.com/2021/11/02/using-the-past-to-help-us-to-understand-the-future-of-the-palace-of-westminster/)—due in part to parliamentarians’ refusal to work anywhere but the Palace of Westminster.
- [Faculty at the University of Manitoba are on strike—and students are supporting them with memes.](https://twitter.com/SeanCarleton/status/1455938345700257792)

All the best for the week ahead!
