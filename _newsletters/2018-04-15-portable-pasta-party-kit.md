* food as a social occasion
* pasta as something easy to make, easy to share, brings friends together
* offer to bring pasta party (party can be as few as three!) to your house
* food doesn't have to be homemade, nor does it have to be at home: thinking back to
  seeing Tim Hortons as a social venue, where people regularly meet and talk (or
  Seven Shores after walking!)
