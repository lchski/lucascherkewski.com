A beautiful Sunday morning to you. I’m quite content today: the sky is blue, the air is cool, and I’ve little to do. Yesterday was hotter, so I minimized my activity and kept to air conditioned spaces. This had me at the movie theatre all afternoon—I watched _Pavarotti_ for the second time this week,  and watched _The Grizzlies_ for the first time.

I’ll save my thoughts on _The Grizzlies_ for now (until I’m done Tanya Talaga’s Massey lectures, which touch on related issues). Today, I’d like to talk about opera.

Luciano Pavarotti was, as for many, my gateway into opera.

At some point, I started listening to one of his innumerable greatest hits albums. I didn’t understand the words, other than a few bits of French. I didn’t know any of the stories behind the songs, either—opera plots were beyond me. (The few I tried to read about were too complicated to keep straight.)

But I could _feel_ the emotion. Whenever I was feeling a lot—happy, sad, whatever—I’d turn to this album. I knew the songs in order, the rise and fall of the notes, the overall feeling of each piece. They’d accompany me through my own emotions.

Eventually, I started learning Italian. Partly this was out of curiosity—one side of my family is Italian. ([My grandparents are big opera fans.](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/82-making-time-music-silence/)) Partly it was to better understand these songs I loved so much.

What I didn’t expect was how much learning Italian increase my interest in opera. Just as [sharing the story behind the music makes _Philadelphia_’s opera scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwRHwKZSu-w) so great, understanding the lyrics deepened my understanding and appreciation for these songs. I expanded beyond the Pavarotti album, listening now to entire performances. In June, I saw my first opera in person, [_Le nozze di Figaro_, at the NAC](https://nac-cna.ca/en/event/18724). Seeing the onstage antics accompanying the music and lyrics tied it all together.

There was much I enjoyed in the Pavarotti documentary. My favourite parts were the interspersed performance clips. Carefully chosen, the arias reflected whatever aspect of the singer’s life was being discussed at that point in the film. How you can grow with music, how your life can be reflected in a particular song or performance—it makes me happy just thinking of it.

Anyhow, this is all from me for the day. Opera isn’t for everybody, but it’s certainly a genre where careful attention and study can yield great reward. Here’s one of my favourites: “[Recitar! ... Vesti la giubba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iKp6wH5-ro)” (or, [watch Pavarotti perform it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xgavEdFU), and [read along with a translation](http://www.aria-database.com/search.php?individualAria=595)). The contrast between the public and private face fascinates me. It’s a very moving piece.

All the best for the week ahead!
