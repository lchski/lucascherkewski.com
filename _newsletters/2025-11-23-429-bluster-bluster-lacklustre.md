Hello!

Talk went well! The fine folks at [BSides Ottawa](https://bsidesottawa.ca/) put on a great event, and it was good fun to discuss the finer points of the legislative process with a room of cybersecurity folks. It also allowed me to advance one of my favourite arguments, that the same skills that enable you to read code are the ones that enable you to read legislation—they’re not so different, in the end. I’ll try to put the slides and notes on my site, for those who asked. Thanks to all who expressed interest.

Between that, a flurry of gift making in the shop, and a combo set of flu / COVID shots, though, I’m wiped. Here’s to chiller times ahead. (Dear reader, I doubt they will be chiller. Though they will be chillier!)

Buuuuut I can’t send you off without some links:

- Every topic in this week’s _University of Winds_ is up my alley, and maybe yours, too: ‘[Cleaning Supplies are Extremely Stupid, "Your Temper, My Weather", Workers Inquiry](https://www.uofwinds.com/425/)’ (I’ll be thinking about chill beekeepers the rest of the week!!)
- Ava captures so well something I’ve caught myself doing, “[the superiority complex of the screen minimalist](https://blog.avas.space/screen-minimalist-superiority/)”, then neatly chops it down
- I wanted to share this when they sent it the other week, but there wasn’t yet an archive link—now, though, enjoy [a day in the harvest life of Fat Gold](https://fat.gold/field-report/45/) (an olive oil company)
- “We learned the value of making and disrupting. But mostly, how to be whole and kind humans, using noticing as an opportunity for making and making change.” – Liz Danzico, remembering [how her dad (and mom!) instilled the values of making](https://bobulate.com/2025/11/the-sound-of-making/)
- Lots of highlights in my copy of this piece by Winnie Lim on [personal growth (and the pace it takes)](https://winnielim.org/journal/waiting-for-my-self-to-grow-up/)
- Ethan Marcotte [on the inevitability of technological statements about the future](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-line-and-the-stream/), and other ways forward
- Speaking of technological statements about the future, this coverage of [solar roll-out in sub-Saharan Africa](https://climatedrift.substack.com/p/why-solarpunk-is-already-happening) is _fascinating_ (the style is too breathless for me, but the vision compelling)
- “[How to fix a typewriter and your life](www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/20/us/typewriter-repair-seattle-bremerton.html?rsrc=flt&unlocked_article_code=1.208.dNOm.2D3afHcNPh8R&smid=url-share)” – ‘nuff said (via [Andy Baio](https://waxy.org/))

All the best for the week ahead!

P.S. Title credits for this week go to [Antidote](https://www.antidote.info/en/), my favourite dictionary app, which has an excellent built-in search functionality. Winds this week gave me the “bluster, bluster”, and a rhyme felt fun—Antidote made it easy to find a rhyme, even letting me choose which syllables I wished to rhyme with. (Okay, now this sounds like a bad podcast ad—truly, I’m just a fan!)
