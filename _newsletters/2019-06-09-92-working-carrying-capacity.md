Last December, I had a challenging week. I had six days to complete four finals for courses at school. Surprisingly, I emerged from this period with my finals complete having worked an average of only six hours a day.

Recent conversations at work have me reflecting on that week. It contains an important lesson for me about when and why I’m productive.

- December exam period; contrast with normal school months, looking ahead to next year (with fewer courses)
- situation at work
- is that pace sustainable everyday? what of the weekend? (https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/06/who-killed-the-weekend) _dolce far niente_

Description:
~6 h a day of focused work during exams (avg 6.67, but 6 if you accept that not all of those recorded hours were fully focused), though there’s probably some overrun in those records and they include about ten minutes of break per hour. (Pomodoro technique, woo!)

Observing workplace, some coworkers seem to be always in intensely focused work, while others seem to have more flexibility and variance in their day. (Note that they’re all awesome at their work and I love them all the same.)
