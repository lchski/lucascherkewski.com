Last December, I had a challenging week. I had six days to complete four finals for courses at school. Surprisingly, I emerged from this period with my finals complete having worked an average of only six hours a day.

Recent conversations at work have me reflecting on that week. It contains an important lesson for me about when and why I’m productive.

From this experience (backed up with other anecdote), I know that I can manage about six hours a day of focused work. (Those hours include a few minutes break each hour.) Outside these six hours, I can still work, but I’m not doing my best work—this is when, ideally, I turn to administrative tasks.

My team at work has been reconsidering our approach to tracking work in progress. About a year ago, every team in the organization was encouraged to adopt agile approaches to organization. I work on a policy team—we’re not a delivery team in the traditional sense. We don’t have a product upon which we iterate regularly, nor do we ship on a regular rhythm. Those familiar with frameworks that embrace the agile philosophy might leap to kanban. At the time, we had more experience with scrum approaches (learned from our time embedded in product teams), so we started working in sprints. (Though very rarely did we actually sprint.)
