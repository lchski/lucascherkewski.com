Last December, I had a challenging week. I had six days to complete four finals for courses at school. Surprisingly, I emerged from this period with my finals complete having worked an average of only six hours a day.

Recent conversations at work have me reflecting on that week. It contains an important lesson for me about when and why I’m productive.

From this experience (backed up with other anecdote), I know that I can manage about six hours a day of focused work. (Those hours include a few minutes break each hour.) Outside these six hours, I can still work, but I’m not doing my best work—this is when, ideally, I turn to administrative tasks.

My team at work has been reconsidering our approach to tracking work in progress. I’ll spare you the details (for now), but the gist is that we’re dropping some organizational approaches in favour of lighter ones. There are two aspects of this that I’d like to touch on.

## Focus

With our new flow, I hope to attend to the degree of focus or thoughtfulness required for a given task. Requesting the creation of a secured folder (this is sadly something that requires a special request) is a much lighter task compared to, for example, thinking about how to best measure the efficacy of a delivery team. Accordingly, I’d try to make focused time for the latter, leaving the former for a less focused period.

You may know that [I track my time rather carefully](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/33-keep-going/). While this can be helpful for planning activities, the data don’t capture how focused I was during a given work session. On a good day, one focused hour can equal several unfocused ones. I wonder, then, whether I should add a focus measure to the working hours I track.

## Sustainability

My team is quite stretched right now. Another reason behind this new workflow is so we always know our next best step.

When I think of my six hour figure, I wonder how long I can sustain it. I know, for example, that on the weekends I don’t manage much focused work. I’m somewhat torn over this: I’d like to ship side projects, but [do nothing/do little weekends are also important](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/06/who-killed-the-weekend). How sustainable is focus? Or is it like a muscle, something that strengthens with training? ([Cal Newport would likely defend that point.](http://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)) Given the limited availability of focused time at work (a problem of its own), my team is consciously setting ourselves up to put that focus where it matters most.

Today has been a relatively quiet day, as was yesterday. Though I was out and about, I had no strict plans. It’s a refreshing change from the regimented work week. But with too many of these weekends I get a growing unease, a sense that I’m not accomplishing all I might. In any case, that’s a concern for another day. All the best for the week ahead!
