Last December, I had a challenging week. I had six days to complete four finals for school. Surprisingly, I emerged from this period having worked an average of only six hours a day.

Recent conversations at work have me reflecting on that week. It contains an important lesson for me about when and why I’m productive.

From this experience and other anecdata, I know that I can manage about six hours a day of focused work. (Those hours include a few minutes break each hour.) Outside these six hours, I can still work, but not at my best—this is when, ideally, I turn to administrative tasks.

My team is rethinking our workflow. I’ll spare you the details (for now), but the gist is that we’re swapping a heavy(ish) organizational approach for a lighter one. There are two aspects of this that I’d like to touch on.

## Sustainability

My team is quite stretched right now. One reason behind this new workflow is so we always know our next best step.

When I think of my six hour capacity, I wonder how long I can sustain it. I know, for example, that on the weekends I don’t manage much focused work. I’m somewhat torn over this: I’d like to ship side projects, but [do nothing/do little weekends are also important](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/06/who-killed-the-weekend).

How sustainable is focus? Do we have a limited capacity to carry on with it? Or is it like a muscle, something that strengthens with training? ([Cal Newport would likely defend the latter.](http://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)) Given the limited availability of focused time at work (a problem of its own), my team seeks a sustainable amount of focused work.

## Focus

With our new flow, I also hope to consider the degree of focus required for a given task. Handling an administrative task is much lighter than considering how to measure the efficacy of a delivery team. I’d seek focused time for the latter, deprioritizing the former.

You may know that [I track my time carefully](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/33-keep-going/). Unfortunately, the data don’t directly capture my degree of focus. On a good day, one focused hour can equal several unfocused ones. I’m considering tracking my focus for working entries.

Today and yesterday have been quiet. Though I was out and about, I had no strict plans. It’s a refreshing change from the regimented work week. With too many of these weekends I grow uneasy, thinking I could do more. But for now, I’m indulging myself.

All the best for the week ahead!
