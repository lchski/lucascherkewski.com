It’s “cold” but not really cold today. Once you’ve endured a few months of winter, the body seems to adjust its perception of temperature—what feels unacceptably frigid in the early fall quickly becomes a pleasant winter day, even “nice” and “warm”. I’m in the front room, sun streaming in and the window open wide. My feet are a bit chilled by the breeze, but my core is warm, and I’m enjoying the contrast.

[About this time last year, I started to see the signs of spring.](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/129-spring-feelings-readings/) They’re not quite here yet, but we feel on a precipice. There’s a run of zero-ish weather in the days ahead. The snow will start to melt, yielding slush and puddles for weeks. I often forget this part of winter, but it’s the necessary counterpoint to frigid days and accumulating snow, completing the cycle, again and again.

I had to remind myself earlier today of [what I find relaxing](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/therapeutic-things/), casting about for something to ground me and set me at ease. (I’m okay, on the whole, don’t fret!) While my list of therapeutic things is indeed helpful, I think it’s missing an important note on context. Remember: when you’re facing existential dread, processing heavy news, or so on, don’t do it on an empty stomach, make sure you’re drinking water, and so on, if you can help it. Those therapeutic activities need a healthy host to do their best work.

A few links for you, this week:

- I rarely listen to podcasts, but this one was _worth it_. I’ve long followed both Roxane Gay and Debbie Millman in their respective fields, and [was thrilled when I first read about their engagement](https://www.autostraddle.com/roxane-gay-and-debbie-millman-are-girlfriends-thats-big-news/). Well, [Brené Brown recently interviewed the two together, and it’s a lovely conversation](https://brenebrown.com/podcast/brene-with-roxane-gay-and-debbie-millman-on-love-life-and-the-pursuit-of-creative-space/). (There’s a transcript, too, if that’s your jam!)
- I’m not sure how I came across it, but [this Black Ottawa Scene obituary of Desmond Doran is a beautiful portrait of a community figure](http://blackottawascene.com/in-memory-of-desmond-doran/). To live a full life, as he clearly did—a worthy goal.
- Libraries are essential public spaces. [This history of the Toronto Public Library, as told through a few of its key buildings, is a great celebration of the library in its varied forms.](http://activehistory.ca/2020/09/a-history-of-the-toronto-public-library-in-four-buildings/)

All the best for the week ahead.
