Good morning! I’m more than halfway through the book for this afternoon’s book club. Most likely I won’t finish, but that’s what long ago reading Pierre Bayard’s _How to Talk About Books You Haven’t Read_ prepared me for. (Though I’ll be honest with my friends that I haven’t read today’s book, and admit to being open to spoilers!)

This feels a good enough time for a media diet update:

- The book club book is _Intermezzo_. I don’t feel it lives up to the hype. It’s good, sure, but feels also pretty predictable? In the way life can be, I guess.
- Last night, we watched _It Ends with Us_. Heavy topic (dealing with domestic violence). T’d read the book, I haven’t. Again, I thought it was… fine? Didn’t blow me away, somewhat sensitively handled a weighty subject matter, but the character development seemed a bit lacking and many of the interactions too predictable (again, maybe life).
- Not doing much internet reading these days, or at least little of note. Still reading loads of RSS feeds, with lots saved to read later, but not engaging deeply with much; the days have been busy and my mood generally a bit glum.
- I injured my wrist last weekend (boo!), which has meant no time spent woodworking (extra boo!). It’s also meant that I haven’t biked to work this week (yet more boos!), despite decent weather (okay, a yay!). Walking, though, has given me time to catch up on some podcasts, including a few episodes of [_Complex Systems_](https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com) (always excellent—I can feel my brain shifting into another gear while observing these conversations), [_The Ship Report_](https://shipreport.net) ([h/t Erin Kissane](https://www.wrecka.ge/about/)), [_Ben Franklin’s World_](https://benfranklinsworld.com), [_Women at Warp_](https://www.womenatwarp.com) (sadly wrapping up next March), and [_The Paul Wells Show_](https://paulwells.substack.com/s/the-paul-wells-show-podcast). 

Anyway—I’ve been feeling in a bit of a cooking slump. Still good at the old favourites, of course, but less frequently trying out new dishes. Are there any you’ve been enjoying lately?

I hope the November scaries aren’t getting to you too much. Always up for a walk or a chat if so (or even if not!). All the best for the week ahead!
