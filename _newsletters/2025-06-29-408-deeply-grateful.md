It has been quite a week. 

First, an update on Arthur: he is doing (relatively) well. It’s been a rollercoaster you wish you could get off, with a dramatic twist nearly every day. Thursday, we transferred him to another animal hospital for an emergency surgery. He’s now at home and very happy to be here, resting often and with a long recovery ahead, but in so many ways his normal self. 

Second, an enormous thank you to everyone who wrote or otherwise expressed support in the past week. I’ve shared each message with T, and we’ve appreciated them so much. “[Comfort in community](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/407-comfort-community/)” was the apt-est title for what we’ve experienced—thank you. I hope to be able to reply individually in the days ahead, but know that we’ve read and been warmed by every message.

Third, a few reflections on this week:

- A state of constant stress is a hard one to leave. We’re not out of the woods yet—Arthur’s recovery will require at least a few weeks of careful monitoring, medication, and so on—but even now that things are more cautiously optimistic, our bodies and minds remain palpably on edge. It’s hard to believe the good times will stay, even as you cautiously, carefully hope they will.
- Relatedly, round-the clock care is _intense_. Now that we’re caring for him at home (something we thought we might not even get the chance to do), I’m extra appreciating the work that goes into supporting critically ill patients (including the work that T does at the hospital). So much to deal with in the moment and proactively—not to mention keeping yourself reasonably nourished and rested and so on.
- There are really good people out there. The professionalism, competence, and kindness of the (many) providers we’ve worked with has been a balm for the soul. The generosity of family and friends (including some very generous financial support, without which we would’ve been facing even harder decisions) has literally made it possible to get through this week.
- Oh, the things you’ll get excited over! This morning, we woke to him cuddling with us, only to realize he’d wet the bed in a few spots. After a scare yesterday where he went quite a while without peeing, we were positively thrilled to wake up like that.

Even when it’s hard (and oh goodness is it hard), I’m trying to slow down and just be grateful to get this time with him. It’s so clear that he’s happy to be home—us, too, buddy.

Thank you again for the kind words and support throughout the week. All the best for the week ahead.

Lucas
