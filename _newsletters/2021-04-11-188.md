I spent much of yesterday afternoon lazing about, basking in the sun and feeling a cool breeze waft over me. Reading, puzzles, radio—none of them were doing it for me yesterday, but quiet pondering was.

By evening, I was able to get outside, doing one of my regular routes in and around Parliament Hill. Construction continues apace, so I took a gander at the many big holes and funky structures going up. It’s amazing to see how _permanent_ some of the “temporary” construction infrastructure is—[though I suppose that’s to be expected for a 10+ year project](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/an-elaborate-sequence-of-projects-in-restoration-of-parliament-hills-historic-centre-block).

Big things take time—and that includes quiet downtime, now and again.

- Justin Ling, continuing in an excellent series of articles on public technology and its impacts on handling the pandemic, [explored the fragmented systems for infectious disease tracking in Canada](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-public-health-data-meltdown/).
- Bianca Wylie, continuing to advance important conversations in public technology governance, [on the democratic risks of Canadian governments’ longstanding practice of outsourcing critical public technology](https://biancawylie.medium.com/digital-rights-government-it-and-public-service-ethics-78b7e97bf127).
- A great TikTok of when [“an awesome grandma comes bopping by”, dancing to her own beat](https://www.tiktok.com/@omgitslindz/video/6948514752310070534). (Sidenote: that video was shared with me, probably originally via the TikTok app—the amount of metadata in it was enormous! *shakes fist at data-obsessed web*)

All the best for the week ahead!
