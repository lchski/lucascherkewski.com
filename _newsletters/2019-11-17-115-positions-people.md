Hello there!

A happy Sunday to you. I'm writing after a weekend of coffees, walks, movies, reading, and _Don Giovanni_. I hope yours was equally nourishing.

One of the great pleasures of my job is that I get to work with my good friend and colleague, [Sean](https://twitter.com/sboots/). When we sat together, we’d often engage in random side of desk conversations. (They were literally side of desk—we’d lean over to see each other without our monitors in the way.) During these chats, we’d discuss our latest adventures in (digital) government (reform). We often developed small theoretical frames to explain what we were experiencing.

I wanted to share one of those theoretical frames with you tonight. I wrote it up, only to realize that it became too long for this newsletter—so I’ve moved it to its own post. It’s actually a model Sean originally developed, one I find quite applicable for understanding organizational change. I encourage you to read about the model, which he graciously gave me the go-ahead to write up.
