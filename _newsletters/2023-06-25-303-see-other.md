Hello!

It’s been a very full week, and I don’t have much in the tank to write today. I hope you’re all doing well, and taking care, especially if you live somewhere (like Ottawa) where the air quality is so manifestly bad.

I was saying to T this morning, it’ll be interesting to see if/how people learn about air quality in future years—wearing a mask seems so negatively identified with COVID for some, I wonder how many will just continue defiantly not wearing one, even with wildfire smoke (which is so clearly bad!!). Sadly, it seems we’ll be reckoning with this more and more often.

All the best for the week ahead,

Lucas
