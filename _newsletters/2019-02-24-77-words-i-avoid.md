There are some words that I try not to say. They’re not swear words. They’re everyday words, words that, though seemingly innocuous, are possibly harmful or exclusive.

Some examples:

- “Just” (not in the “justice” sense) and “only”: These two words minimize effort. When I use them when speaking with someone else—“Can you make this change? It’s just a small tweak, it’ll only take you a few minutes.”—I diminish that person’s agency, suggesting that I know their trade better than they do or that I deserve to intrude on their time because I think it’ll only be a short while.
- “Of course” and “obviously”: These exclude people who aren’t in the know. By slipping them into my phrases, I suggest that my conversational companion should know what I’m talking about. This puts a distance between us when they don’t, especially if we don’t have a trusting relationship. These ones really do slip in—you can almost always drop them from a phrase and it’ll continue to make sense.

Some criticize this kind of self-editing, suggesting that it’s a form of censorship imposed by the liberal lords of political correctness. (You can’t see it, but I engaged in some major eye roll as I wrote that 🙄.)

I see it differently.

For one, I think [it’s part of being polite](https://medium.com/s/story/how-to-be-polite-9bf1e69e888c). I have yet to find a good reason to be impolite. These words and others like them, though not overtly _rude_, can surface power imbalances and distance participants in a conversation where they’re used. That’s not great—I prefer to avoid those things.

But I also want to challenge this popular narrative that rails against “self-censorship” (or, to avoid the overtones of “censorship”, “self-editing”). We’re _always_ editing ourselves. Much of this editing is unconscious. There are some topics that rarely if ever occur to me to think about or discuss. [Choosing what to pay attention to](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/DFWKenyonAddress2005.pdf) and thus what to think about is a sort of self-editing.

Take candle scents as an example. I don’t often talk about them. The thought never even occurs to me to do so. It’s unconscious, but it’s self-editing nonetheless: I haven’t incorporated candles into my life, so I don’t encounter candle scents much, so I don’t ever think of them and thus never discuss them.

We unconsciously edit our potential conversations all the time, by editing what we incorporate into our lives. Making this process conscious and extending it to the words we use doesn’t seem so bad. Especially if it stops you from hurting someone else.

So [pay attention](https://niemanstoryboard.org/stories/pay-attention-be-astonished-tell-about-it/), to both the world and yourself. Edit yourself ruthlessly—you’ll be better for it. All the best for the week ahead.
