Hello!

It’s one of those Sunday mornings where I puttered around quietly, made a relaxed trip to the grocery store, cleaned the apartment with the music turned up, reconciled my finances, and so on—making space for reflection through the routine.

This week, I thoroughly enjoyed the National Arts Centre Orchestra’s performance of [_Women Rock_](https://nac-cna.ca/en/event/18713). Pops orchestra arrangements of some of the best songs by women performers (“rockeuses” en français, I love it) from the 60s, 70s, and 80s? Yes, please! Check out [the set list](https://nac-cna.ca/en/event/notes/18713) for a taste.

The three singers who fronted the show—alphabetically, Cassidy Catanzaro, Katrina Rose Dideriksen, and 
Shayna Steele—were incredible. Each brought something to the songs that, in combination with the orchestra (conducted by Bob Bernhardt), transformed them from the recordings with which I was familiar. And everybody onstage seemed to enjoy themselves, an infectious sort of fun that was picked up by the audience.

Several times that night, the conductor turned around to admire whichever vocalist was singing at the time, whenever they hit and sustained a particularly impressive note (which happened often). Though ostensibly the conductor is “in charge” during shows like these, at some moments they can’t help but stand back in awe, basking in the singer’s power just like the audience. I can think of similar moments in more traditional performances, when the conductor defers to a soloist who takes the show to new heights.

I think there’s something to take from such moments to how we work on any team. While teams often have somebody who—whether externally appointed or through some natural process of selection—leads the group, I think the best way for a leader to act is as a sort of facilitator. They create the conditions within which their team can realize their potential, reaching heights that maybe even those team members didn’t realize was possible. Such leaders know when to step back and admire their team’s achievements, giving space for their team members to take it away on their own.

Anyhow, that’s what rattled through my head while I reflected this morning. All the best for the week ahead!

PS: If you’re interested, I published some pieces on my site in the last few weeks. Continuing this theme of performances, [I thought about _Springsteen on Broadway_](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/springsteen-broadway/). I also I shared [what I enjoyed most in _If Beale Street Could Talk_](https://lucascherkewski.com/links/2019/01/08/21-00-letterboxd-barry-jenkins-beale-street/). And, finally, I noted [some of Ursula Franklin’s definitions](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/franklin-definitions/) for key terms related to pacifism (and living well).
