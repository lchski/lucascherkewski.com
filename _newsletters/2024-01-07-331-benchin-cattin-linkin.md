Thank you to all who wrote in with kind words wishing T and I well last week. Happy to report that we’re both back to our normal selves. (Which, for me, means various age-inappropriate aches and pains that remind me I ought to stretch more, but at least they’re _proper_.)

I’ve spent a good chunk of time this week working on that workbench I mentioned. It’s more or less the one from [_The Naked Woodworker_](https://lostartpress.com/products/the-naked-woodworker) (it’s a very forgiving design, particularly for someone working with just hand tools, [one that works impressively well without a vice](https://blog.lostartpress.com/2014/12/03/workholding-with-the-naked-woodworker/)). It’s been nice to have a project to go putter away at for a while each night—nice, too, to slowly learn my limits, to remember to put the tools down and tidy up at a reasonable hour, so I don’t stay up all night thinking about woodworking. It’ll still be there tomorrow, I try to remind myself :)

The _other_ thing that happened this week is that a cat showed up on our back deck. She’d been around for a few weeks, but this week seemed to be begging us for food and shelter. We put a paper collar on her, to learn if she had a home, but nobody contacted us—since then, we’ve brought her inside (it got pretty cold in Ottawa this week), scanned her for a microchip, found none, and now have a cat living in the spare room. She’s incredibly sweet, and we’re figuring out what to do with her—I think we’ll know over the next little while whether A is getting a little sister. Regardless, it’s been a fun dynamic in the house this week!

Anywho—some links!

But I particularly enjoyed [her note connecting Schulman’s work to that of Stanley Dekker’s on accountability](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/refusal).

- [Paul Wells may seem at his best when writing about Canadian politics](https://paulwells.substack.com/p/politics-in-2023-canadian-zoetrope), but [some of my favourite work of his is his thoughtful, plugged-in thinking about jazz](https://paulwells.substack.com/p/a-maestro-for-an-age-of-borders).
- [John Batt, curator of the @gov.canada.ca Instagram, was recently profiled for his hilarious work.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/article-canadagovca-instagram-john-batt/) You should [check out @gov.canada.ca](https://www.instagram.com/canada.gov.ca/) if you haven’t—prepare for some rabbitholes.

All the best for the week ahead!
