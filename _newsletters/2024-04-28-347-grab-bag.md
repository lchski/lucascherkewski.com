Hullo!

It’s been a good weekend—tending to some long in-progress projects, planning some new ones, and trying to do some maintenance around the house. Also, ice cream and time with friends in the sun! The week also featured some good excitement, including a chat about getting Ottawa Civic Tech back in (some kind of) gear. May is shaping up to be a very busy month, but looking forward to seeing all the change (and hopefully energy!) it brings.

Links! In three groups!

Work-y:

- Continuing a recent theme of being curious about what's happening around you (at work, or anywhere, really), the who / what / how / why of it all, [an interesting method for doing so, keeping a “WTF notebook”](https://www.simplermachines.com/why-you-need-a-wtf-notebook/).
- Some folks with a good view on it [thinking through and reflecting on the recent news about the shuttering of the Ontario Digital Service](https://thinkdigital.ca/podcast/the-end-of-the-ontario-digital-service-and-what-it-means/).

Woodworking:

- When wanting to idly read about woodworking, I’ve been reading posts in order from the start by the [Apartment Woodworker](https://theapartmentwoodworker.com/), a lawyer who does woodworking in his spare time (and space!). “[Necessity versus Generosity, or Why I Make Things](https://theapartmentwoodworker.com/2014/12/14/necessity-versus-generosity-or-why-i-make-things/)” is a good example.
- Relatedly, [a profile of a woodworker that explores woodwork as an endeavour for social good](https://blog.lostartpress.com/2021/12/19/mario-rodriguez-and-his-life-changing-couch/) (including sweat-equity renovation and teaching woodworking to kids).

Grab bag:

- The ideas and contrast of the [“merger” and “seeker” selves from Gail Sheehy (via Maria Popova)](https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/04/21/gail-sheehy-merger-seeker-passages/) are really relatable, insightful frames for living and social relationships.
- It’s fascinating to see [budgeting as something streamed to social media](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/apr/20/every-penny-has-a-purpose-the-rise-of-zero-based-budgeting). (Also, I do zero-based budgeting, and it works great for my brain!)
- More from the _Canada Declassified_ project, featuring [Pearson and some hilarious wartime letters about baseball](https://timsayle.substack.com/p/pearson-plays-ball-in-washington).

All the best for the week ahead!
