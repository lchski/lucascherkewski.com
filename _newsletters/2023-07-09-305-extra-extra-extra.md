Hello!

Coming off a lovely weekend full of T time, family time, friend time, and hobby time—very glad for all the people I get to share life with. It’s left me quite tired, though, so I’ll just share some links with light annotation. T and I are finishing _The Terminal_ and an ice cream cake tonight, so there’s much to save my brain for!!

- [Commentary, history, and links to more history on Ethernet, which just turned 50 years old.](https://om.co/2023/07/03/ethernet-is-50/)
- [I didn’t know the Ontario Food Terminal is publicly owned, nor that it primarily serves the _not_ major brands.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-want-lower-grocery-bills-give-canadians-a-more-diverse-retail/)
- [On the use (or not) of secret intelligence in government, and what it says about political-bureaucratic incentives.](https://christopher-parsons.com/2023/07/06/secret-intelligence-in-secret-intelligence-resistant-political-and-bureaucratic-cultures/)
- I am shocked but not at all surprised to learn that [Pimisi station—one of the Ottawa LRT stations likeliest to host large crowds—is not built for large crowds](https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/pimisi-lrt-station-not-built-for-substantial-crowds-ottawa-police-say-1.6466969).
- [To rebuild Notre Dame, they have to first reforge the medieval axes that dimension the timber.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/notre-dame-de-paris-restoration-fire-axe-1.6900169) I find the expense and extravagance poured into restoring this church to be mindboggling, but if you’re going to go all out, I guess you really need to go _all out_.
- [Morning routines, yes, but also being more chill about said routines.](https://rachsmith.com/reassessing-the-morning-routine/) Rach Smith, thank you for this.

Thank you for being a wonderful part of my week, every week. If I haven’t replied to an email from you recently, I hope to soon! All the best for the week ahead!!
