“Words Have Special Meanings When Computers are Involved” reads the title of the editorial in the October 1983 issue of *Output*, the newsletter/journal of the Educational Computing Organization of Ontario.

One word that I’ve considered lately is “feed.” I recently revisited Twitter after a short hiatus (discussed in [issue #12](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/12-bye-bye-birdie/)). 

* where’s that word from? how do we use it now vs previously?
	* OED, Antidote
* feed in sense of animal feed, sating our cravings (feed as object and as action)
* didn’t miss Twitter in the way I expected (missing the voices versus missing the scrolling) (Twitter replaced with LinkedIn)
