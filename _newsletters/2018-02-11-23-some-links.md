Hello!

I hope you’re well. This week is my a final push here in Ottawa before spending a few days in Waterloo for reading week, so I’ve got my head down in work. For you this week, I have a link roundup!

1. I didn’t think it possible to write [an entertaining article on paper jams](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/why-paper-jams-persist) (the thought never occurred to me to write one at all), but Joshua Rothman’s treatment of his cast of characters is truly wonderful.
2. Jia Tolentino [profiles a team of researchers at Columbia University](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/is-there-a-smarter-way-to-think-about-sexual-assault-on-campus) and their project to improve the environment on college campuses, with an eye to reducing sexual assault. What struck me about these researchers was their approach: they designed their studies *with* students (co-creating is perhaps the trendy term?) and their research seems stronger for it.
3. I did not know of Dean Allen before reading [Om Malik’s touching tribute](https://om.co/2018/01/18/dean-allen-rest-in-peace/). By the sounds of it, he wasn’t perfect, but he was perhaps perfectly imperfect. [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/2018/01/dean_allen), [Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org/18/01/rest-in-peace-dean-allen), and [Greg Storey](https://medium.com/airbag-industries/so-not-very-cool-70e8a3db4422) each wrote about Dean, too, with worthwhile links to some of his colourful writing.
5. Based on [this interview](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/jessica-bellamy), Jessica Bellamy should be celebrated as a design hero. Her commitment to enabling others politically through design is an inspiration.
4. I recently revisited David Foster Wallace’s “[This is Water](http://bulletin-archive.kenyon.edu/x4280.html)”, and it remains as arresting as ever.
6. While I never played Neopets, I’ve long heard it touted as a creative space where so many learned how to make websites. [Nicole Carpenter dives into its history of inspiring girls](https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/neopets-a-look-into-early-2000s-girl-culture-w509885)—I love this.
7. If you’re a freelancer or don’t have steady income and you need a way to visualize how much revenue you still need, [consider whiteboard accounting](https://web.archive.org/web/20110826075301/http://blog.frankchimero.com:80/post/2764593863).
8. Do you need your heartstrings tugged? Read [this story on how a Second World War veteran’s unit celebrated his 100th birthday](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/don-couch-veteran-100th-birthday-1.4522064).
9. Denise Balkissoon [tears down the cult of the mediocre man](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/justin-timberlake-and-the-fall-of-the-mediocre-man/article37878657/)—“mediocrity hires” is a spot-on reversal of “diversity hires”.
10. Frank Chimero published [his latest talk](https://frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/), and it’s an ode to a simpler way of thinking about and working on websites. As always, recommended reading.

That’s all I’ve got for this week! All the best for the week ahead.
