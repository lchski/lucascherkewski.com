After a hurting week for those who care deeply about municipalities and local government, here are some links on why local community is so important:

* Naheed Nenshi, mayor of Calgary, [critiqued the news about Toronto’s councillors and the regional elections](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/canada/article-its-for-all-of-us-calgary-mayor-nenshi-attacks-ontario-premiers/).
* Erika Hall [celebrates the beauty of “human-scale transactions”](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/erika-hall/2018-april-12) in the midst of so much noise and so much isolation.
* Sameer Vasta [on the merits of “small”](https://www.inthemargins.ca/small).
* Some months ago, [some Toronto residents decided to make their neighbourhood safer in the absence of city action](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/11/29/neighbours-take-street-safety-into-their-own-hands.html). (Let’s also appreciate that Sabrina Nanji’s byline includes “Democracy Reporter”.)
* And, finally, I’d like to celebrate one of my favourite community-driven organizations, [The Working Centre](https://www.theworkingcentre.org). The organization runs a network of important services throughout Kitchener-Waterloo, and also publishes [a wealth of resources about living locally](https://www.theworkingcentre.org/strategies-sustainable-livelihoods/622).

That’s all for me this week! When things feel all too big and abstract, try turning to what’s small and concrete: the community around you. All the best for the week ahead.
