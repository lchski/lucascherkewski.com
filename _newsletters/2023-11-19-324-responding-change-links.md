After a very days-and-nights-busy work week, it was nice to have things a bit more normal this week. T and I are getting ready to host our first overnight visitor in the new place, which has been an effective impetus for me to finally finish unpacking and tidying the office / spare bedroom—it’ll feel good to have it in order, to have all the things in (more or less) a proper spot and all the boxes folded away.

Escaping the stress of things to do at home, we joined S and V for a recital this afternoon. The performances by Kathryn Patricia Cobbler and Sonya Sweeney were excellent—there’s something to beautiful music and a beautiful space reinforcing each other, making it all so much more pleasant.

Links from this week (ish):

- [How might we prepare ourselves to handle inevitable uncertainty, change, even disaster, in our personal lives?](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/look-to-the-ground/) I particularly liked the reframe from “How do I make the *right* decision?” to “What’s the potential harm that might emerge from this decision, and what structures might protect us from that harm?”
- [Martha wrote up her reflections and memories from FWD50.](https://medium.com/@mlhedwards/my-fwd50-reflections-and-takeaways-b631d5f9deb1) Martha’s talk was a highlight of FWD50 for me, and here she shares a few of her own.
- [Luddites weren’t against technology—they were against the inequitable and oppressive distribution of its gains.](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/real-ones) (Yes, that’s a second link from Mandy Brown today. I can’t point you enough toward her reading and writing.)
- [Kudos to Signal for sharing the true cost of running a global messaging service](https://signal.org/blog/signal-is-expensive/), and for explaining how their policy choices directly impact their operating costs. (via [a great “take out the tabs day” post by Matt Jukes](https://digitalbydefault.com/2023/11/19/take-out-the-tabs-day/))

All the best for the week ahead!
