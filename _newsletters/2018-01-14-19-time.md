Hello!

How’s this week going for you? We’re midway through the first month of the new year. (Milestones!) Yesterday morning I read [this lovely piece](http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/10-timeframes/) on time—Paul Ford highlights our attachment to it, playing on different ways of measuring and experiencing its inevitable passage.

This reminded me of the brief history of timekeeping that Nicholas Carr provides in *The Shallows*. As part of his larger exploration of the impact of the internet on our brains, he explains how progressively more advanced forms of timekeeping (from sundials to church bells to a watch on every wrist) shaped our experience of time and the organization of our lives. The history of time intrigues me: it considers the social constructions we’ve built around this constant march.

We can also look at time through the lens of art. Here are three works that grapple with time in interesting ways: *Arrival*, the 2016 film; *Wolf in White Van*, by John Darnielle; *Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage*, by Haruki Murakami. Some question our linear understanding of time, while others play on the continuing influence that events from our past hold over our present and our future.

I feel this with music, too. On Friday night, I saw a local production of *Legally Blonde*, a musical to which highschool friends originally introduced me. Musical soundtracks seem especially capable when it comes to transporting feelings across time. Hearing the *Legally Blonde* soundtrack again bubbled up all kinds of fond memories. On the other hand, some soundtracks, like that of *Mamma Mia!*, I’ve listened to so frequently that no specific memories remain—just the music itself.

Revisiting Waterloo also reminded me of the flexibility of time. Spending time with certain friends transformed me, partially, to who I was when we used to spend much more time together. Being there also caused me to reflect on certain events from the past few years, considering their implications—though they may have been some time ago, they’re still with me.

I had another topic in mind for this letter, but this one grew and grew until it insisted on standing alone. We’ll leave that until next week’s issue. Fortunately, we have lots of time.
