Hello! Here’s to you, here’s to 2020—let’s take this one with gusto, shall we? (Or, y’know, with whatever we can muster. I’m here with and for you regardless.)

My morning writing time evaporated when I fell down a rabbit hole of searching the [Library and Archives archival collections catalogue](http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/collectionsearch/Pages/collectionsearch.aspx) and poking around [digitized microforms in Héritage](http://heritage.canadiana.ca/). What’d I find? Lots of potentially interesting records about postal service in Canada, for the most part. _Update: I just spent another half hour poking around the archival collections. Oops. But also, yay!_ Maybe something for future research and writing.

I wrote this in my phone last night, as I started out on a walk:

> A good walk does not start out warm. It starts cool, or, in the terrible days of summer, comfortable. Then you walk vigorously and warm up, opening a layer or two as you go.

This left me thinking about the qualities of a good walk. In no particular order, here are a few:

- The weather and your outfit allow the walk to carry on indefinitely. Energy is the only major constraint on the duration or distance of the walk.
- It’s got enough quiet in it. Occasional noise (like a busy street) is usually inevitable—and sometimes even welcome!—but a sense of silence or calm definitely enhances the walk.
- Maybe it’s with somebody else. It’s usually nice to share a walk with somebody, but sometimes you need solitude. If there are other people, preferably not too many—unless it’s meant to be a big group, like a walking tour or walking group. The more people, the harder it gets to keep a steady pace or decide where to ramble.

(Apologies if my use of “you” jarred you. [It’s an internal debate of mine.](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/78-i-you-we/))

As you can probably tell, my brain is a bit scattered today. I haven’t had much need to develop a coherent thread of thoughts for a few weeks—that’ll come back, soon enough. To close, then, I’ll share a few interesting links from my recent browsing:

- _Uses This_ is ostensibly a site where people share their go-to gear. But sometimes people share neat tidbits about themselves and their philosophies. Some interviews I read recently and particularly enjoyed include: [Sarah Werner](https://usesthis.com/interviews/sarah.werner/), [Lincoln Mullen](https://usesthis.com/interviews/lincoln.mullen/), [Kieran Healy](https://usesthis.com/interviews/kieran.healy/), and [Megan Prelinger](https://usesthis.com/interviews/megan.prelinger/). Also: [there's such a cool range of occupations out there](https://usesthis.com/categories/)!
- Canada’s federal government used to be, uh, _really_ transparent about public servants. The Civil Service List, published until 1918, named every public servant, by department, including their position, salary, tenure as a public servant, and _age_. You can [see all the lists](http://www.canadiana.ca/search?so=newest&q0.0=su%3A%22Canada+--+Officials+and+employees+--+Registers.%22) or [dive into the last one published, from 1918](http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_09189). The [sunshine list](https://www.ontario.ca/page/public-sector-salary-disclosure) has nothing on this! (Also, uh, we don’t have a sunshine list for the federal government anymore.)
- Audrey Watters holds nothing back in her [list of the 100 worst ed-tech debacles of the 2010s](http://hackeducation.com/2019/12/31/what-a-shitshow). Watters is a really important voice in this space, always speaking truth to power—her list demonstrates a wide range of things to stay vigilant about. (Not that the burden’s all on you to be vigilant about all things always! That’s a lot to ask. But reading a list like this can widen the horizons, helping to realize where surveillance and other not so good things creep into our own daily lives.) This stuff isn’t stopping—[it’s just getting more pervasive and harder to refuse](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/24/colleges-are-turning-students-phones-into-surveillance-machines-tracking-locations-hundreds-thousands/).
- Alex Soble and Elizabeth Ayer at 18F wrote in defense of “[long-term teams, not sudden handoffs](https://18f.gsa.gov/2019/12/03/long-term-teams/)”. This is really on my mind lately—how do we fund, encourage, and enable sustainable teams? How do you prioritize people (both on your team and those you serve) over _(waves hands)_ the rest?
- [Robin Rendle shares a frank assessment of creating design systems](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/systems-mistakes-and-the-sea), urging us to acknowledge how hard the work is, to discuss the messiness that lurks underneath. I love this, because it’s about being honest about the human messiness beneath the surface of, well, everything. Humanity isn’t straightforward, and that causes a lot of problems! Let’s not gloss over that, let’s dig in.
- [Eric Clapton and Pavarotti singing “Holy Mother” is a beautiful duet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9uYu4R2nk8) Opening with Clapton (who plays solo for almost half the performance), then waiting for Pavarotti’s glorious entrance—what a treat.
