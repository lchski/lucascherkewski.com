Restless, I went for a walk last night around 9.

I was looking to be around people while remaining solitary. At times like these, I often walk through Ottawa’s Byward Market, winding through the streets full of people going about their evening fun.

Last night, I was pleasantly surprised by the number and variety of evening events that I passed on my walk. Wandering from the lively market, I walked through Major’s Hill Park, Sparks Street, and Bank Street. Each hosted some sort of outdoor music festival. For “the city that fun forgot”, Ottawa offered plenty of fun last night.

There’s been renewed attention recently to Ottawa’s character. The city now counts a million people (spread out, admittedly, over an enormous geographic area)—[Joanne Chianello calls for the city to act its size](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/city-ottawa-one-million-analysis-1.5173545). Downtown, we’re nearing a disappointing end to the protracted struggle over a proposed addition to the iconic Château Laurier—[Stephen Maher questions whether Ottawa’s essentially bureaucratic character is to blame for its lack of architectural confidence](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-ottawa-cant-have-nice-things/). (This reminds me of [an old Paul Wells piece on why Ottawa’s quiet character is something to celebrate](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/world-class-whine-why-ottawas-haters-are-wrong/).)

The Château Laurier’s much-maligned expansion is held out as an exemplar of Ottawa’s crumbling respect for its picturesque views. Generally, I agree with the concern. (Though apparently no longer a favoured architectural style, I’m a fan of [the nearby Lord Elgin Hotel’s 2004 expansion](https://lordelginhotel.ca/hotel/history/), which paid homage to the building’s original style.) Beyond picturesque views, though, I’d like to hear a louder conversation about the availability of beautiful, _indoor_ public spaces.

Ottawa is a wintry city. As this year’s slow start to summer reinforces, cold weather is our reality for much of the year. When it’s cold, it snows; when it’s not quite so cold, it often rains. When the weather permits it, we have a host of excellent outdoor public spaces—parks, trails, and patios abound. But I think we should push to open more of our _indoor_ spaces.

I touched lightly on this the other week,
