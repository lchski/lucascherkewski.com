Restless, I went for a walk last night around 9.

I was looking to be around people while remaining solitary. At times like these, I often walk through Ottawa’s Byward Market, winding through the streets full of people going about their evening fun.

Last night, I was pleasantly surprised by the number and variety of evening events that I passed on my walk. Wandering from the lively market, I walked through Major’s Hill Park, Sparks Street, and Bank Street. Each hosted some sort of outdoor music festival. For “the city that fun forgot”, Ottawa offered plenty of fun last night.

There’s been renewed attention recently to Ottawa’s character. The city now counts a million people (spread out, admittedly, over an enormous geographic area)—[Joanne Chianello calls for the city to act its size](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/city-ottawa-one-million-analysis-1.5173545). Downtown, we’re nearing a disappointing end to the protracted struggle over a proposed addition to the iconic Château Laurier—[Stephen Maher questions whether Ottawa’s essentially bureaucratic character is to blame for its lack of architectural confidence](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-ottawa-cant-have-nice-things/). (This reminds me of [an old Paul Wells piece on why Ottawa’s quiet character is something to celebrate](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/world-class-whine-why-ottawas-haters-are-wrong/).)

The Château Laurier’s much-maligned expansion is held out as an exemplar of Ottawa’s crumbling respect for its picturesque views. Generally, I agree with the concern. (Though apparently no longer a favoured architectural style, I’m a fan of [the nearby Lord Elgin Hotel’s 2004 expansion](https://lordelginhotel.ca/hotel/history/), which paid homage to the building’s original style.) Beyond picturesque views, though, I’d like to hear a louder conversation about the availability of beautiful, _indoor_ public spaces.

Ottawa is a wintry city. As this year’s slow start to summer reinforces, cold weather is our reality for much of the year. When it’s cold, it snows; when it’s not quite so cold, it often rains. When the weather permits it, we have a host of excellent outdoor public spaces—parks, trails, and patios abound. But I think we should push to open more of our _indoor_ spaces.

I touched briefly on this the other week, while discussing how nice it is that [Doors Open temporarily makes public otherwise locked-down spaces](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/91-doors-open/):

> I dislike exceedingly expensive architectural projects funded by the public that are then closed to the public.

We should put more emphasis not just on our skyline, but also the accessibility of public spaces within those buildings. I have trouble with expensive public investment in publicly inaccessible buildings (like those in the parliamentary precinct). I understand the desire for high quality spaces for politicians and so forth—I often bemoan our hesitation to spend public money on architecture. We ought to favour more spaces like the National Arts Centre: default to open, keeping private the minimum of space necessary.

How might we do this? For one, celebrate projects like the [Ottawa Central Library](https://ottawacentrallibrary.ca/). But also, push for public spaces in the downtown—once the current central library branch is closed, we’ll lose a key public space in Ottawa’s downtown. One way to do this is to extract concessions from developers when creating new spaces. If the Château Laurier expansion goes ahead, we should at least demand that it offer public spaces. Though not an interior space, I think of [Performance Court’s seventh floor terrace](http://www.150elgin.com/public-and-green-space-150elginstreet.html), [publicly accessible thanks to a deal with the City](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/property-report/curtain-opens-on-performance-court/article19296244/). (Performance Court also features an interior, publicly accessible art gallery.)

The last bit I’ll note on this subject: when we create public spaces, we ought to make them actively inviting. Certain spaces, like Performance Court’s terrace, are public but not publicized—so folks don’t know they can take advantage of them. The City might more actively catalogue and celebrate the spaces it offers. (Though this could also be [an opportunity for small businesses](http://ottawadetours.ca/tour/public_space/) or civic tech.)

Okay, before I go, I have two links to share with you, via two other awesome newsletters:

- Next time you plan to have a few free hours, [consider exploring a library’s special collections](https://tinysubversions.com/notes/library-archive-tourism/). (Via [Sameer Vasta’s weekend reading newsletter](https://www.inthemargins.ca/raptors-champions).)
- [Our spaces inform our rights and freedoms.](http://www.primitivism.com/needs-illich.htm) (Via [Mita Williams’s _University of Winds_ newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/UniversityOfWinds).)

All the best for the week ahead!
