	Re-learning how to relax. Last time I updated this page (seven months ago!), I prefaced it with “More of the same”.
	That’s a fair descriptor for where I’m at now, too. What’s different, though, is that I’m returning to the same
	with the benefit of experience and (hopefully refreshed) eyes. You have better a chance to shift the familiar if you’ve
	been there before, y’know?
</p>

<p>
	Professionally, I’m returning to full-time work at the <a href="https://digital.canada.ca">Canadian Digital Service</a> (<abbr title="Canadian Digital Service">CDS</abbr>)
	until the end of April. My experience working with <abbr title="Canadian Digital Service">CDS</abbr> over the last few months has
	rewarded me significantly. I look forward to more of the same, but also to being more effective at my work—and thus able to find
	ways to make that work easier for others.
</p>

<p>
	Academically, I’m taking a break. I may work at a few academia-adjacent projects, like <a href="https://his3305.labs.lucascherkewski.com/">my analysis of speeches from the throne</a>, or I may just let myself
	take a few months to breathe.
</p>

<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
	Personally, I’m getting ready for winter. Winter is hard—it’s cold and dark, people are harder to find, and you struggle
	to find the energy to engage strongly with the world. But I plan to do my best to turn that energy inward, to better engage
	with myself (and thus the world). It’s been a tricky little while, and I’m hoping to build a better independent base for myself.
	Expect to see more activity around here (including the <a href="/links/">recently-developed links section</a>).
</p>

<p>
	That said, I’m also wary of becoming a social hermit, so if you’d like to get together—whether we see each other all the time or
	it’s been a while—please <a href="mailto:lucas@lucascherkewski.com">reach out</a>. If you’d like to hear more of where I’m at, I publish <a class="dim light-purple" href="/hit-and-miss/">a weekly email newsletter</a>. Every week I wonder whether I’ll know what to say next, but something always tumbles out (whether for better or for worse I’m not quite sure).
</p>

<p>
	The last few months have weighed on me. I’ve been tired in both a micro and a macro sense. There’ve
	certainly been moments of lightness, ones in which that tiredness has faded away, but on the whole
	it’s all been a bit much. Most of all, I plan in the months ahead to re-learn how to relax, to regularly reclaim that lightness—here’s hoping!

Things interesting me at the moment:

* Winter—the quiet, the cold, the space for solitude.
* Literature—I’ve tended toward non-fiction for years, but I’m once again attracted to the potential
  of stories.
* Italian—it’s a familiar but foreign language, one I’m enjoying exploring.
