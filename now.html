<p class="f3 measure lh-copy">
	New year, new me? Hardly so—I keep plugging away.
</p>

<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
	Professionally, I’m gearing up to find a co-op job for next summer. I’d like to combine
	my interest in policy with my experience as a web developer. How or if that will manifest, I’m
	still sorting out. I’m also doing some small projects before school gets too heavy.
</p>

<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
	Academically, I’m working on my small <a href="/study/urop/" class="dim light-purple">research project</a>
	into Ontario teachers and educational computing in the 1980s. I’m analysing my findings, considering
	their implications for the history of education and today’s “edtech” conversations.

	Personally, I’m <a class="dim light-purple" href="https://lucascherkewski.com/study/digesting-ideas/">reading ravenously</a>:
	revisiting old favourites and discovering new ones, I’m enjoying myself in the process. It feels good to read.
	Much to my own surprise, I’ve been publishing <a class="dim light-purple" href="/hit-and-miss/">an email newsletter</a>
	every week. I don’t know if this regular practice is producing improvement, but I’m hopeful.

<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
	This feels like a time of <em>change</em>. Maybe it’s the wishfulness of a new year or the
	optimism of a new term (an optimism whose intensity inevitably tames as deadlines approach).
	Looking around I see friends carving out interesting niches; reflecting on myself, I find shoots
	of my own. It’s winter now—perhaps by spring, something will have grown.
