but really it's about trust in government, right?

if GC built this (or funded it, and it'd probably be by CCCS, aka CSE, aka cyber spies), how soon would we get to coverage (reputable or not—and, of course, “reputable” implies a certain position in terms of trust, “reputable to whom”, and so on) claiming “the government wants all your passwords”, “there must be a backdoor”, “the cyberspies are behind this”, etc etc

and maybe that's just where we're at! also, I mean, why trust a company bought by a hedge fund with your passwords, idk. but we trust our pension money with hedge funds, so, anyway, I digress.

for there to be trust _in_ government, there also needs to be trust _from_ government. of which we're pretty significantly lacking:

- consider how GC deals with media requests: we shift to the defensive (issues management—Brian Kelcey thread), dodge and weave. part of that is because comms is an area closely tied up in the political realm (or, more precisely, with keener awareness of and exposure to?), and that’s our politics—see QP and election debates as an example.
- need to prove “entitlement” for benefits—rigamarole to access EI, CPPD, etc. re-prove your lifelong disability!

so I don't think there'd be a productive conversation around this (do we really have “national conversations” anymore? have we ever? what does that even mean?), and it'd fall pretty quickly to conspiracy / lack of trust territory—which is likely somewhat deserved, to a degree!
