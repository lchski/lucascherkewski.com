* virtual representation from 1760s/70s, GB-US dispute
* sentiment persists variously: NCVR, role of MP (delegate/mandate/etc),
  party discipline (if an MP is elected for their riding but has to follow
  the party line, are they really representing their ridiing?)
* Speech to the electors of Bristol
* at the time, many in GB were disenfranchised, yet they were "represented"
