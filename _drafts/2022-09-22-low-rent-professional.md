We often joke at work that CDS’s policy team is “a bunch of low-rent lawyers”. At times, that shifts to “low-rent accountants”—it really depends on the professional domain in front of us that day.

I recently wondered at how my technical background as a software developer (a low-rent software engineer, if that were a protected profession :wink: [TKTK if it’s protected or not TKTK]) contributes to the ease of slipping into, in particular, legal and accounting work:

- (formal) logic - though my programming education wasn’t formal, and didn’t include deep-dives into logic, you learn it intuitively on the job
- structured data - data analysis work
