- put aside enough $ in a trust of some kind so that the interest pays for the domain name
	- the most important space to "rent" (since all references are to it—even if content moves, you can ID them through the URL)
	- who'll maintain this in trust? ensure payments go to domain company? administer DNS [lol] to point toward hosting
- make a sizable enough donation (honestly maybe not even much? $100 one-off, given economies of scale?) to Internet Archive to host your content "forever" (aka as long as IA is around / university etc mirrors)
	- point domain toward that permanently, redirect
	- "death mode" of some sort, where you signal the site will no longer be updated but should be hosted in perpetuity
	- IA knows not to redirect in infinite loop
	- maybe a more thorough crawl to also capture interactive elements, or to capture site as a human would see it (versus IA bot?)
