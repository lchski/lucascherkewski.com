[for when “TV as background” and “watch” posts are published]

Reading Michael Harris’s *Solitude* last week, this passage jumped out at me:

> [Quentin] Crisp pitied those who couldn't carve out solitary moments for themselves; he saw _them_ as victims, not himself. When he watched his hyper-connected friends flicking on the radio or using the television as background company, he saw that the point of these devices was “not to entertain but to drown the ticking of all clocks.”

Succinctly, Harris and Michael capture the points I wrote of in two posts last week, one [on TV]() and the other [on noisy watches]().

(Sidenote: I love the phrase “using the television as background company.”)
