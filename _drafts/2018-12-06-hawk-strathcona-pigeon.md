The ducks in the reeds that I was watching suddenly jumped, and I heard the flock of pigeons behind me take flight. Turning around, I saw that a bird of prey had pounced on a pigeon, pinning it down.

It brought to mind a few lines from Mary Oliver’s “Wild Geese”:

> Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
> Meanwhile, the world goes on.
> Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
> are moving across the landscapes,
> over the prairies and the deep trees,
> the mountains and the rivers.

While despair isn’t quite the right word to describe it, I was certainly preoccupied with personal thoughts at the time. Seeing the world go on pulled me out of that quagmire, at least for a time.
