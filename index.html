<p class="page__intro h1">Hia!</p>

<p>
	Welcome to my home on the internet. Nice to have you here.
</p>

<p>
	This is what I care about:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Remembering the humans.</em> Everything we do comes back to people—care for them.</li>
	<li><em>Questioning arbitrary barriers.</em> Disciplines are human constructions—mix them.</li>
	<li><em>Listening.</em> Nobody has every answer—consult widely and humbly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I work on projects that attempt to combine those principles, usually by building thoughtful digital tools to
	improve non-digital experiences.
</p>

<p>
	This site holds what <a href="/study/">I’ve written</a> and what <a href="/links/">I’m reading online</a>.
	I wrote <a href="/study/manifesto/">a manifesto</a> to suggest what a personal site is to me.
	You can learn about <a href="/now/">what I’m doing now</a>.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I really do view this as my home on the internet. Feel free to come in and make yourself comfortable;
	explore these public workings of my brain and get to know me a bit better.
</p>

<p>
	If anything here strikes you, don’t hesitate to
	<a href="/contact/">talk with me</a>—I look forward to hearing from you.
</p>
