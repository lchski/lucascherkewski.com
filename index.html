<p class="measure-narrow f2 lh-copy mb3">
	Welcome to my home on the internet.
</p>

<p class="measure f3 lh-copy">
	This is what I care about:
</p>

<ul class="measure mt3 mb3 f3 fw3 lh-copy pl5">
	<li class="mt2"><em>Remembering the humans.</em> Everything we do comes back to people—care for them.</li>
	<li class="mt2"><em>Questioning arbitrary barriers.</em> Disciplines are human constructions—mix them.</li>
	<li class="mt2"><em>Listening.</em> Nobody has every answer—consult widely and humbly.</li>
</ul>

<p class="measure f3 lh-copy">
	I work on projects that attempt to combine those principles, usually by building thoughtful digital tools to
	improve non-digital experiences.
</p>

<p class="measure f3 lh-copy">
	This site holds what <a class="dim light-purple" href="/office/">I’ve worked
	on</a> and what <a class="dim light-purple" href="/study/">I’ve written</a>.
	I wrote <a class="dim light-purple" href="/study/manifesto/">a manifesto</a> to suggest what a personal site is to me.
	You can learn about <a class="dim light-purple" href="/now/">what I’m doing now</a>.
</p>

<p class="measure f5 lh-copy">
	P.S. I really do view this as my home on the internet. Feel free to come in and make yourself comfortable;
	explore these public workings of my brain and get to know me a bit better.
</p>

<p class="measure f5 lh-copy">
	If anything here strikes you, don’t hesitate to
	<a class="dim light-purple" href="/contact/">talk with me</a>—I look forward to hearing from you.
</p>
