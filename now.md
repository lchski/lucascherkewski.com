Now! Now? Now. Nowwwww.

Okay, it’s been a long while since I updated this page. Just over two years. Oops.

So, well, it’s been quite a time, hasn’t it? I’ve been between Ottawa and Waterloo, mostly keeping to Ottawa as the COVID-19 situation has worsened.

Professionally, I’m still having a good time at the [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca) as a policy advisor. I plan to focus on a few things over the next few months:

- honing our advice on interventions for large-scale technology projects;
- improving our data management practices;
- supporting a platform delivery team.

But last time I made plans, everything went out the window and we delivered [COVID Alert](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert.html), so who knows what’ll happen to these three activities.

Personally, I’m getting ready for winter. (I used this sentence two years ago. [_stet_](http://stet.editorially.com/articles/a-beginning-for-stet/)) Though I love winter, I reckon this one’ll be harder than most. But we’ve trained for this, built up new social practices and so on. It’ll be okay.

I hope to dig into [some of the many books on my shelves](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/141-new-shelves/). In particular, a few I look forward to:

- _Middlemarch_
- _Parable of the Sower_ (and its sequel, if I can muster the emotional energy)
- _Emergent Strategy_
- _Beowulf_
- _A Civic Technologist’s Practice Guide_

But who knows—reading can take you in weird and wonderful directions! If you want to follow along, [I’m on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27072166-lucas-cherkewski). (Or, as I call it, “[the wholesome social network](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/73-wholesome-social-network/)”—Amazon ownership aside.)

I’ll probably also be watching lots of _Star Trek_! As of the other week, there are over 800 pieces of _Star Trek_ content, across its myriad series. So much good to enjoy. Maybe I’ll watch some more recent TV, but let’s be real—I’m a sucker for rewatching.

And oh, hey, this site! Last time I updated this, I’d just created [a new links section](/links/). It still feels new, because I only kept at it for a bit. But going back through recently, I remember more from those links than most others I’ve encountered over the years. So I hope to give it another spin. (This, along with a redesign I’m toying with, should keep this site plenty interesting.)

If you’d like to catch up, please [reach out](mailto:lucas@lucascherkewski.com). If you’d like to hear more of where I’m at, I publish [a weekly email newsletter](/hit-and-miss/). Every week I wonder whether I’ll know what to say next, but something always tumbles out (whether for better or for worse I’m not quite sure).
