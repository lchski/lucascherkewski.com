	How can we work together? I’m an independent contractor who bridges gaps. If you’re facing a vacuum of some sort, I’d
	love to see how I can help you fill it.

<p class="f5 measure lh-copy">
	I’m especially experienced in and excited by front-end design and development work. I can determine the needs of the people
	you serve, design a solution to address those needs, and implement it.
</p>

<p class="f5 measure lh-copy">
	I'm comfortable working within existing teams, filling knowledge or skill gaps. Regardless of the situation, I'm
	always dedicated to contributing quality work.
