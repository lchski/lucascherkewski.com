- have just started reading Maria Popova’s _Figuring_
- first chapter, on Kepler
- importance of romantic thinking, of imagination, in expanding our perspective: first we imagine, then we work toward it
	- Ray Bradbury: ‘“It’s part of the nature of man to start with romance and build to a reality.”’ (12)
- importance of storytelling in helping people understand, accept scientific observations: data and theory don’t shift perspective like a good story (hence Kepler’s _The Dream_) (16)
	- Denise Levertov: ‘poetry’s highest task is “to awaken sleepers by other means than shock”’ (24–25)
- describing footnotes as “hypertext” (22)
