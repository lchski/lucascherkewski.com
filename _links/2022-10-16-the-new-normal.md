How do we make our organizations more resilient, in the face of burnout and continued COVID (or other) uncertainty? Heidi Waterhouse argues for:

- increased staffing
- clear succession plans (deputization, who can step in for each position?)
- set objectives (what you plan to achieve) and agreements (what you promise to achieve), with the space in between being your “error budget”—this helps you set your plan
- document all your projects (owner and deputy, stakeholders, key dates, scope and description, resources needed)
- document and communicate in a way that enables continuity
- “give grace”
