Clearleft is doing some crypto-adjacent work for a financial services company. Fascinating to see Jeremy—co-founder of Clearleft, [though now it’s an employee-owned company](https://clearleft.com/thinking/meet-the-new-owners-of-clearleft)—grapple so publicly with his discomfort with a project his employer’s working on. Interesting to contrast with the liberty that public servants have (or, more importantly, feel to have / not have) to do the same. (Though I think Jeremy’s pretty public and vocal here, even for private sector.)
