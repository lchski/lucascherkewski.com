> Finally remember that exposure to COVID isn’t binary. You are trying to minimize the *frequency* and *quantity* of your exposures to the virus. You probably cannot reduce exposure to zero. What you can do is reduce exposure to a level where the virus doesn’t infect you. Or at least reduce it to a level where you have a less serious case of COVID. So any amount of mask wearing that you can do is better than never wearing one. So if the only way you can bring yourself to wear a mask is to periodically take breaks and take it off, that’s still more effective than not wearing a mask. It’s still a better choice.
