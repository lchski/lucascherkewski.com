Great writeup of the long, thoughtful, careful effort required to remove a key dependency from a large (in some ways legacy) application. And the benefits thereof: better performance for site visitors (and for GOV.UK there areâ€¦ many) and a cleaner codebase, making for easier sustaining efforts down the line.
