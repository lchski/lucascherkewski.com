Eric Meyer shares a compelling idea: through custom CSS, deemphasize images on Twitter that donâ€™t have alt text. This rewards those who take the time to add alt text, as their content remains visible.

I like this approach, a quiet incentive to make the web accessible to all. [So describe your images on Twitter, make them accessible for everyone!](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions)
