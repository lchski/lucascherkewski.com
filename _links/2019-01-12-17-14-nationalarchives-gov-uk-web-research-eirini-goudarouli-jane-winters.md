Succinct summary of a research conference discussing the potential of web archives for academic research. Interesting suggestions:

> Areas for future research suggested by the groups included: the history of online advertising; the analysis of viruses and malware in web archives; histories of organisational change as it plays out on the web; the study of web art and digital creative literature; the exploration of online redaction and emendation; and an investigation of digital communication by government.

This immediately brought to mind the [Archives Unleashed Project](https://archivesunleashed.org/) and [Ian Milligan’s academic work on web archives](https://uwaterloo.ca/history/people-profiles/ian-milligan).
