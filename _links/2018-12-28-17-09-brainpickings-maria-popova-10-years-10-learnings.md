Maria Popova shares, after ten years of running [_Brain Pickings_](https://www.brainpickings.org/), shares ten “core beliefs, written largely as notes to myself that may or may not be useful to others” to which she has returned repeatedly:

> 1. Allow yourself the uncomfortable luxury of changing your mind.
> 2. Do nothing for prestige or status or money or approval alone.
> 3. Be generous.
> 4. Build pockets of stillness into your life.
> 5. When people try to tell you who _you_ are, don’t believe them.
> 6. Presence is far more intricate and rewarding an art than productivity.
> 7. “Expect anything worthwhile to take a long time.”
> 8. Seek out what magnifies your spirit.
> 9. Don’t be afraid to be an idealist.
> 10. Don’t just resist cynicism — fight it actively.

With each, Popova provides a fuller description, with links to other pieces at _Brain Pickings_ that dive in deeper. But, as she notes ([echoing J.S. Mill](/links/2018/12/28/17-03-wikisource-js-mill-on-liberty-ch-2-common-sayings/)), it’s not enough just to read these—they’re “refined and enriched in the act of living”.
