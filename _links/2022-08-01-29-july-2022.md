Curry quotes a journalist who followed the entire Grenfell inquiry, who writes incisively about the failures on hand, accountability, and the shrivelled state of public sector capacity (in the UK, here, but hardly exclusively). A good example of the power of an inquiry to surface, focus, and nuance private and public thought on an issue (a disaster, in this case).
