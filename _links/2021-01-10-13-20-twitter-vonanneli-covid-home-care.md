Excellent list of advice for how to treat yourself at home if you get COVID-19. Includes key symptoms for when to escalate your care—i.e., when to go to the hospital.

I found myself nodding along with [Erin Kissane’s observations on the dearth of good advice like this](https://twitter.com/kissane/status/1348101214307721219). It’s frustrating that there’s so much good public health advice on prevention, but relatively little on care once you get it. The latter, [given Canada’s growing numbers](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html), is more necessary than ever.
