These—or a similar set of—authors write a piece on declassification every year or so, rightly calling attention to Canada’s lack of (and sluggish progress toward) a declassification system for historical government records. It’s notable that the examples they give are of other governments *automatically declassifying some of the most theoretically sensitive information they hold*, records related to national security and intelligence.

If it’s possible for natsec elsewhere, surely it’s possible for the routine and mundane here.
