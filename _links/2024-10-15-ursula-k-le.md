So I reread Le Guin’s speech yesterday, it having recently popped up in my feeds. But only today did I notice her addendum explaining her reference to The Boss, celebrating his seriously underappreciated _Lucky Town_, and praising him generally. Could she be any more awesome? Reflecting on her nearly ten years later, I think not.
