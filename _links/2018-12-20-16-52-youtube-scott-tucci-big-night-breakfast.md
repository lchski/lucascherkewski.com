My calmest, most focused moments in life mirror the qualities of this scene: a quiet attention to doing the routine well. Whether cooking a go-to meal, washing the dishes, or [walking a familiar route](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/walking-routes/), I often find some happy contentment in activities like theseâ€”movie moments, of sorts.

Similarly, I enjoy movies that portray the ordinary in close detail, like someone quietly getting up and going about their morning routine.
