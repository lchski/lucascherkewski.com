Includes a great overview of the merits of sidenotes (versus footnotes or endnotes) on the web—we may have screen real estate to use, so why make your reader jump around? Looks like [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) or [sidenotes.js](https://www.gwern.net/Sidenotes#sidenotes-js) are good options. (I’m considering sidenotes for a redesign hereabouts.)

Incidentally, _Gwern.net_ is _tricked out_. There’s a lot of _web_ in that website, interactive features that are both playful and useful. Neato.
