I _was_ writing this morning, until I realized that last night’s sudden upward temperature swing combined with a heavy downpour would have melted all the snow cover, and then of course I had to check out the data for nearby rivers and streams to see whether that’d cause an increased flow. And it did! Yay for publicly-available data.
