Neat exploration of _very precise_ table numeral formatting (e.g., aligned around a decimal) with pure CSS. A few times through I thought, “Why bother? Why not just do default CSS alignment?” But this is part of [a labour of love to recreate a book with near perfect accuracy](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/08/09/recreating-the-effects-of-nuclear-weapons-for-the-web/), and I think it’s perfectly fine to ask _yourself_ for “pixel” perfection—even if we’re (hopefully) largely past that in the professional web design and dev work (though maybe that’s wishful thinking from someone only indirectly in the industry these days).

I also loved Eric’s nod to [a _24-year-old_ bug in Firefox related to an unimplemented portion of the CSS2 spec for the `text-align` property](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2212). The web is so fun.
