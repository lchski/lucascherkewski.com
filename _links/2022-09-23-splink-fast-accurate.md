Awesome to see a powerful, high-performance data science tool released as open source, by a government team no less. Splink, developed based on advice from three academic experts on data linkage, allows for partial weighted record matchingâ€”fuzzy matching across multiple variables, that is, with different weight given to each. This has come at a fortuitous time, looking forward to using this.
