Striking that one of the changes in the CDC’s reorg relates to leadership tenure:

> Altering the length of time agency leaders are devoted to outbreak responses to a minimum of six months – an effort to address a turnover problem that at times caused knowledge gaps and affected the agency’s communications.

Good parallels to other government service work, too: leaders need time (likely much more than six months) to do their jobs well; [one way is to fit the work to the leadership tenure](https://sboots.ca/2022/08/09/shrink-projects-to-fit-leadership-turnover-rates/), another, the CDC’s apparent approach, is to be more intentional about those tenures.
