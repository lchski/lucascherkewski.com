> The wider organisation still too often sees DDaT as a service provider not a partner and *too often when things get difficult the default in DDaT is to talk about redesigning or reforming the organisation/civil service/government rather than make hard/pragmatic choices about how we can deliver the best possible services in the context we are operating in*. Shipping good stuff builds trust and trust gives us space to do more, better. To be honest I don’t think anybody disagrees with this – it is just hard.

Emphasis mine. This hit especially home as a policy person (on a strategic policy team, at that!)—where the yearning for structural reform as an “easy answer” always feels strong. But, of course, it’s hardly easy.
