<h1>Primary heading</h1>

<h2>Secondary heading</h2>

<h3>Tertiary heading</h3>

<h4>Extra-tertiary heading (why do you have a heading this low in the hierarchy)</h4>

<p>This is a short paragraph.</p>

<p>This is a paragraph of middling length. It doesn’t go on for too long. It says what it means to, and finishes.</p>

<p>
	This is a long paragraph. It goes on for some time, like <a href="https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/1-earthworming/">my old essays</a>.
	I’m glad I’ve tightened them up now. That said, there’s sometimes so much to say.
	Since the days when I wrote such long essays, I’ve improved at splitting a long paragraph out into two or three.
	But I still struggle at times. Hence why I’m including a paragraph of such length—to make sure that any
	such long paragraphs still look <em>good</em>.

	What a view!

<p>Nice photo, eh? I took it at <a href="https://www.gallery.ca/">the National Gallery in Ottawa.</a></p>

<p>I go to the Gallery a lot. My favourite spots there include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The one pictured above, sitting on the patio at the cafe.</li>
	<li>The Rideau Chapel when it has the audio exhibit of 40 voices.</li>
	<li>The staircase in the contemporary gallery, with the piece of paint names.</li>
</ul>
