<h1>Primary heading</h1>

<div class="meta">
	<p>{{ site.time | date: "%e %B %Y" }}<sup>*</sup></p>
</div>

<p>Followed by a paragraph.</p>

<h2>Secondary heading</h2>

<p>Also followed by a paragraph. A secondary paragraph.</p>

<h3>Tertiary heading</h3>

<p>Also also followed by a paragraph. A tertiary paragraph, you might say.</p>

<h4>Extra-tertiary heading (why do you have a heading this low in the hierarchy)</h4>

<p>Also also also followed by a paragraph. An extra-tertiary paragraph, you might say, though you probably shouldn’t say such a thing.</p>

<p>This is a short paragraph.</p>

<p>This is a paragraph of middling length. It doesn’t go on for too long. It says what it means to, and finishes.</p>

<p>
	This is a long paragraph. It goes on for some time, like <a href="https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/1-earthworming/">my old essays</a>.
	I’m glad I’ve tightened them up now. That said, there’s sometimes so much to say.
	Since the days when I wrote such long essays, I’ve improved at splitting a long paragraph out into two or three.
	But I still struggle at times. Hence why I’m including a paragraph of such length—to make sure that any
	such long paragraphs still look <em>good</em>.

<p class="caption">
	What a view!
</p>

<p>Nice photo, eh? I took it at <a href="https://www.gallery.ca/">the National Gallery in Ottawa.</a></p>

<p>I go to the Gallery often. My favourite spots there include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The one pictured above, sitting on the patio at the cafe.</li>
	<li>The Rideau Chapel when it has the audio exhibit of 40 voices.</li>
	<li>The staircase in the contemporary gallery, with the piece of paint names.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	You’ll notice that that list isn’t ordered. I don’t much like ordered lists, because I
	don’t much like ranking. But I shall try to rank something—my favourite ice cream flavours:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Chocolate</li>
	<li>Chocolate</li>
	<li>Chocolate</li>
	<li>Vanilla</li>
</ol>

<p>And now, a short diversion.</p>

<hr>

<p>In <em>The Real World of Technology</em>, Ursula M. Franklin shares her “Franklin’s earthworm theory of social change”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Social change will not come to us like an avalanche down the mountain. Social change will come through seeds growing in well prepared soil and it is we, like the earthworms, who prepare the soil. We also seed thoughts and knowledge and concern. We realize there are no guarantees as to what will come up. Yet we do know that without the seeds and the prepared soil nothing will grow at all. … What is needed is a lot more earthworming.</p>

<p>And it’s always good to comment some after providing a quotation.</p>
