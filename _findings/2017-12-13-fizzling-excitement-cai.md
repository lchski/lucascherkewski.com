Starting to think the story here is the fizzle out of excitement over computer-assisted instruction (CAI). Early on, there are many references to CAI as a much improved version of teaching. ECOO authors sometimes dismiss those who think the computer can be just for drill and practice, or just to learn practical skills like word processing. They insist on the possibilities of CAI: individualization/customization in delivery and feedback, distance learning, etc. But over time, it seems to switch a bit. (Need to investigate this through frequency of topic codes.)

Part of project relate ECOO newsletter findings to broader conversations in CAI. It has roots going back to the 60s, it seems, with Seymour Papert (though maybe not, he was more about programming). Is it still active today? Where are we at now?
