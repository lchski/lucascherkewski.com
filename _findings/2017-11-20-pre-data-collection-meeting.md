<small class="i">Narrative note: At this point, I’d found the newsletters of the
Educational Computing Organization of Ontario. I knew they contained something interesting,
but we had to figure out what was worth investigating.</small>

* Could do a prosapography (a collective biography) of contributors
* Conference theme of “Computing Knows No Borders”: clearly an optimistic take
* Who is missing from contributors? What voices/perspectives/sectors aren’t found in *Output*?
* Content analysis: could consider the people involved *or* what they discussed (or some combination of both)
* How did contributions change with time?
* What were the hopes? Why werepeople willing to dedicate time to this [educational computing and/or *Output*]?
* Studying articles and collecting some authorship information to allow basic demographic analysis
* Articles to read: Edward Ayers, “[Does Digital Scholarship Have a Future?](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2013/8/does-digital-scholarship-have-a-future){:link}”; Chad Gaffield, “[The surprising ascendance of Digital Humanities](https://www.digitalstudies.org/articles/10.16995/dscn.2/){:link}”
