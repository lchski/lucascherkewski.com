Narrative note: At this point, I’d read ~290 articles from *Output*, compiling
data about them in a database. I’d done some preliminary analysis, but wanted to review my steps
and thinking to date before moving on.
{: .f4 .i .measure}

## Original thinking
{:h2}

* Role of teachers versus the Ministry
	* The Ministry was funding ICON and training
	* Teachers were adapting “on the ground”
	* Conscious adaptation theme
* Effort to put microcomputers in schools (ICON)
* Ideas vs expectations/hopes (why were people willing to dedicate their time) versus reality

## Data collection thinking
{:h2}

* From high hopes for CAI (not mere drill or practical skills e.g. word processing) as potential
  for individualization and distance learning, to their [fizzling out](/study/urop/fizzling-excitement-cai/){:link}
	* Connect newsletter to broader conversations regarding CAI
	* Is CAI still discussed today? Where are we now?
	* Turn from the individualized computer classroom (whether in a school, a home, a library, etc) [to the traditional
	  classroom](/study/urop/from-the-computer-classroom/){:link} doing some things via computer, e.g. teaching word
	  processing or doing research

## Post data collection thinking
{:h2}

* Studying the change in the topics discussed
* The increasing professionalization (but also stagnancy/decline?) of ECOO
* Specific question: ECOO *Output* as the period under study; topics discussed (including the change therein); the people
  involved; perspective of the Ministry versus the grassroots (shifting relationship because of cuts to GEMS funding)
	* What do discussions in *Output* reveal about the attitude of Ontario teachers toward educational computing in the
	  1980s and 90s? (misses ICON and Ministry references, but maybe not required)
* General question: how consciously people prepare for the introduction of tech, where that preparation originates
  (in the grassroots versus from the top, or a combination)
	* Fitting the Ontario case to some general cycle
	* Supporting ECOO material with Ministry documents
	* What issues people foresaw, how dreams differed from reality

## Pre analysis meeting notes

* Alison Prentice on the introduction of blackboards in the 19th century
	* Blackboards represented a shift toward teacher as the central figure (versus the *individualized learning* offered from slate-based work)
	* Teacher control via the blackboard
* General question: technology in the classroom, social adaptation
* Use Ayers as a closing note, on the broader implications: Are we really transforming?
