- Pierre Bayard’s _How to Talk About Books You Haven’t Read Yet_. Bayard articulates well my approach to reading (or, more precisely, discussing) books, particularly literature.

Two knick-knacks. I’m not a collector of them, but I keep these two as reminders:

- Turtle. Of the kindness and thoughtfulness that friends, new and old alike, can show through a gift.
- Cyclist. Of simple distractions and family heirlooms.
