This repo contains the code that powers <lucascherkewski.com>, my personal website.

The site is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). CSS comes from a custom build ([see source](_assets/_tachyons/)) of [tachyons](http://tachyons.io). No JavaScript, reallyâ€”just words touched up to be legible.

If you find a typo, please let me know! Pull requests are welcome. Articles are stored in [`_posts/`](_posts/) and archived issues of *Hit and Miss* are stored in [`_newsletters/`](_newsletters/).

Thanks for stopping by.
