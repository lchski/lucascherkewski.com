Oh snap, it worked! Mastodon posts will now be from my site’s notes section first ([lucascherkewski.com/notes/](https://lucascherkewski.com/notes/)), then syndicated out to Mastodon. (Replies, etc, maybe I’ll figure out one day.)

Props to [@paulrobertlloyd](https://mastodon.social/@paulrobertlloyd) for [getindiekit.com](https://getindiekit.com/) Made this all a breeze.

My setup notes available here: [github.com/lchski/indiekit.lucascherkewski.com/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/lchski/indiekit.lucascherkewski.com/blob/main/README.md) Seems there might be double posting happening—to figure out later.
