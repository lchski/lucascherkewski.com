In the federal Parliament and most provincial legislatures (though not, crucially, AB), the first bill is a “pro forma” one, asserting—wait for it—the legislature’s supremacy over the executive.

Deep irony that Bill 1, a bill designed to give the executive near total discretion over legislative decisions, should take that slot.

Or, as the late Bruce Hicks pointed out, in 2009, perhaps entirely fitting: http://revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?param=196&art=1353 (page 18 in the print / PDF)
