I’ve been inside my own head a fair bit lately. I don’t have a problem with it, really—I’ve been learning to appreciate what my own head has to offer. But that appreciation has increased significantly since picking up and reading Michael Harris’s [_Solitude_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26085732-solitude) last week. In it, Harris offers an accessible meditation on the different manifestations, facets, and benefits of solitude.

What is solitude? Harris doesn’t provide a single definition. It’s probably something to discover on your own, by spending time, well, on your own. Some of the key characteristics of solitude include giving space for your brain to wander, minimizing or eliminating the constant voices of others, and coming face-to-face with your own thoughts, with your own being.

One definition I’ll offer is that solitude is that space wherein you don’t have another person to react in real-time to your thoughts, where the only real-time reactions come from yourself. Reading a book, then, can be a solitary activity, even though you’re “in the presence” of its author. (Harris has a great chapter or two on the shifting nature of reading and writing throughout history, how they’ve been at times more and less solitary.)

How do you practice solitude? Harris doesn’t offer a single recipe. He provides a few examples, including a walk through the woods without a cellphone, reading on your own in a quiet place, or spending a chunk of time completely disconnected from human contact. Here, again, the answer is probably that you need to figure it out on your own, that your version of solitude can come only through practice:

> Sadly, eureka-level daydreams are not handed out to just anyone who wanders though the woods. An annoying truth about daydreaming is that it takes practice to get good at it. (60)

You’ll notice a theme: Harris’s work encourages us to figure out *for ourselves* what solitude is, what it looks like for us. Solitude is by nature an individual concept.

***

For my own reference, I want to note a few of the connections I made, and reactions I had, while reading the book:

* Harris quotes many of my faves: Henry David Thoreau, Alison Gopnik, Rainer Maria Rilke, Vannevar Bush, Neil Postman, Wendell Berry, Maryanne Wolf, Alberto Manguel, Rebecca Solnit.

	In preparing and writing that list, I note that many of those people are guys, and I wonder how much of the privilege of solitude has long been restricted to men. (Harris picks up on this point throughout the book.)
	
	Maybe it’s that a certain kind of solitude, the most disconnected kind, has been traditionally enjoyed by men while women have been forced to find solitude elsewhere. For the latter, I think of [Ursula K. Le Guin’s finding solitude in “the solidity of household life”](https://lucascherkewski.com/links/2018/12/26/15-54-newyorker-julie-phillips-fantastic-ursula-k-le-guin/).

* Harris’s descriptions of how solitude causes us to develop a stronger inner understanding, and the difficulty of communicating that inner understanding (on which more at the end of this piece), came to mind when I read [Jhumpa Lahiri’s account of learning Italian](https://lucascherkewski.com/links/2018/12/23/23-08-newyorker-jhumpa-lahiri-teach-yourself-italian/).

	Lahiri describes the greater understanding gained by working within the constraints of her limited Italian. This is similar, I think, to Harris’s point about how our deep, complex, nuanced inner understanding is clarified by passing it through the constraints of language. When we try to communicate with others, we must inevitably compromise somewhat on our thoughts. Some can better capture the entirety of their thinking—or, perhaps, they have a clearer internal understanding—while others can become frustrated with the limits of language.
	
	This is an important idea in general, but I think it speaks also to our responsibility to be understanding and generous with others: we’re all struggling against the same constraints, so we shouldn’t hold each other too tightly to what or how we speak our thoughts; instead, graciously give space for reconsideration and clarification, to yourself and to others.
	
* Craig Mod, in [his essay on regaining attention](https://lucascherkewski.com/links/2018/12/26/16-27-craigmod-craig-mod-attention/), provides a few examples of rules for doing so. I think these can offer good guidelines for those looking to practice the solitude Harris describes.

* Harris describes our machine-like consumption of social media, a consumption that’s been carefully engineered by cognitive psychology experts working for tech companies. I reflected on my own earlier attempts to cut off my social media consumption, and the realization I had earlier this year of [the rather sinister denotations and connotations of the word “feed”](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/18-feed/).

	This deeply discomforted me, because I realize that I’ve largely failed to cut these things from my life: I recently significantly increased my presence on Twitter and Instagram, but for what? I can’t give a good answer to that question. That worries me. The senseless passage of time on social media—not to mention the business models of these platforms, which rely on our free labour, as Harris describes—offers me, when I try to account for it, very little. So why am I there? Am I trying to fill some hole? Are there other ways to fill that hole? And what does it say that, despite my repeated attempts to get away, I keep returning to these platforms, _despite my deep reservations about them_?

***

To close, I offer some favourite quotations, capturing ideas that particularly struck me.

> The natural world is invested with its own awful, symbolic utterance. It invests our lives with meaning that we cannot find among the crowdings of the metropolis. … In the infinitude of nature a solace and truth is projected for us, reflecting and making sensible all the shifting traumas and quandaries that roughen our lives. (151)

As Harris describes, nature can put us in our place: yes, our troubles are valid, but they’re not the only thing out there; we’re part of a larger world, [a world that goes on regardless](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/meanwhile-the-world-goes-on/).

On the perils of quantification:

> The fallacy of “thinking computers” could be a dangerous one [for computers don’t think, they compute]. The more we believe that our computers and online platforms have beliefs of their own, the more likely we are to bend our own solitary taste and preferences to the seductive, mysterious offerings we receive through glowing screens. (100)

> When we allow sites like Rotten Tomatoes to decide which movies, dinners, and songs we consume, we go along with the myth that our decisions are being made by neutral and unbiased guides. … It’s rational, it’s the crowd, and so it’s undeniably _what is best_. We find ourselves nudged toward the quantifiable. … But we forget: taste is never neutral. (102)

> All this feels “personal” because you keep on seeing things that you want to consume … but at the same time you become trapped inside an algorithmically defined notion of your own taste. Put in a less wonky way: you won’t be exposed to things you _don’t know_, things you _haven’t loved yet_. (107)

The “age of the algorithm” is a phrase I sometimes turn to to describe where we’re currently at. Here, with wonderful phrases like “nudged toward the quantifiable”, Harris touches on many of the points making up such an age: opaque algorithms implying objectivity; over-quantifying and thus devaluing the nuance of qualitative information; the [“abdication of responsibility to algorithms”](https://medium.com/@acroll/i-just-did-what-the-computer-said-330262b80189).

How might we address this? Actively seek out experiences that are new (new albums, new books, etc.), and do so by bypassing opaque algorithms that imply neutrality. To follow the recommendations of a friend or someone you admire is to take recommendations from an algorithm of sorts, from a particular sense of taste. But the key difference is that here the algorithm’s creator is _known_, as is the outline of their sense of taste.

Finally, Harris concludes the book with a description of his thoughts on returning home after a solitary week:

> “How was it?”
>
> His innocent question is like a blow, though, because now I have to explain myself. After such a long stretch of self-containment, with my mind fashioning its own unchecked meaning, the duty of communication feels like a deep puzzle. I haven’t thought up a way to describe my solitude yet, to make it sensible to others. (229)

This captures well the trouble of oscillating between solitude and engagement. The “duty of communication” (I love that phrase) is a tricky one to bear. Rarely do our attempts to share our inner understandings capture the full depth and nuance of our thoughts. Inside us, our thoughts can remain nebulous and formless. In attempting to share our thoughts, though, we’re encouraged (if not forced) to solidify them.

On the one hand, this can feel dirty, to reduce the complexity of our thoughts to something that can be shared. But on the other hand, I think this is an important process to work through: we do benefit from solitude, but we’re also part of a social system; translating our inner understandings into thoughts that others can build on is essential to participating in that social system. Harris’s whole work plays at this interchange, one that I’ll be reflecting on—solitarily and socially—for some time to come.
