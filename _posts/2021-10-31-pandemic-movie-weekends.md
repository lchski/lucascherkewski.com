My former roommate and I started regularly watching movies together
during COVID. Each weekend, we chose a rough theme, and looked for
movies to fit. (Or we worked backwards from the movies we wanted,
devising a theme in retrospect.)

Given the state of the world—and our personal tastes, which heavily
favoured romcoms—we tended toward feel-good films. I can recommend
most of the movies we watched. Here’s the full list, in case you
need a pick-me-up:

| date       | movie                                             |
