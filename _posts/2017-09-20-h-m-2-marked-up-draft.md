I went out for a solo dinner Sunday night. In between courses, I pulled out the
pages pictured above—a printed copy of my draft for the second edition of *Hit
and Miss*, my email newsletter.
{:paragraph}

I’ve long been interested in how other people write. What process do they follow?
Editing, in particular, interests me. (High-school friends will remember
that I was always up to edit their writing—[that offer still stands](/contact/){:link}, for anyone I’ve met.)
{:paragraph}

Most of the edits in here are fairly minor, not particularly interesting. I just
want to call attention to the last line—I rewrote it eight or nine times. To make
sure everyone can read the rewrites, here are the different options I considered. Each
follows the first half of the phrase, “That, and ignoring them as we get on with doing
the work that matters,”
{:paragraph}

* “regardless of what headings it might sit under” *(the original)*
* “regardless of the labels we may give it”
* “regardless of how we may call it”
* “regardless of its labels”
* “its labels notwithstanding”
* “whatever its labels” *(the version I ultimately used)*
* “whatever we may call it”
* “however we may call it”
* “labels be damned” *(dessert had arrived at this point, bringing my process to a, uh, graceful close)*
{:paragraph}

As I write more, I find my desire to edit increases. I want to work and rework my words,
fine-tuning them until they’re better than their original form. Exhausting, at times,
but rewarding in the end. (Even moreso when your hard work is rewarded with rice pudding.)
