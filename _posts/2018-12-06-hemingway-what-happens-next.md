I have very mixed feelings about Hemingway. But when faced with lots of writing, as I am this week, I always find this advice of his useful:

> You read what you have written and, as you always stop when you know what is going to happen next, you go on from there. You write until you come to a place where you still have your juice and know what will happen next and you stop and try to live through until the next day when you hit it again.

Stop when you know what’ll happen next, and trust that you’ll be able to pick up from here upon your return.
