The ducks in the reeds suddenly jumped, and I heard the flock of pigeons behind me take flight. Turning around, I saw that a bird of prey had pounced on a pigeon, pinning it down.

It brought to mind a few lines from Mary Oliver’s “Wild Geese”:

> Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.  
> Meanwhile the world goes on.  
> Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain  
> are moving across the landscapes,  
> over the prairies and the deep trees,  
> the mountains and the rivers.

While despair isn’t quite the right word to describe it, I was certainly preoccupied with personal thoughts at the time. Seeing the world go on pulled me out of that quagmire, at least for a time.

This is why I go to the park and the river almost every day: to remember that, while my own thoughts and feelings and life are valid and so forth, I’m just a small part of a much larger context, of countless creatures and forces pursuing their independent logics.

In writing this, I realize that the end of “Wild Geese” captures precisely this sentiment:

> Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,  
> the world offers itself to your imagination,  
> calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting –  
> over and over announcing your place  
> in the family of things.

Meanwhile the world goes on.
