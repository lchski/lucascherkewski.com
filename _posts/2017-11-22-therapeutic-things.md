As a note to self and in no particular order, here are activities I find relaxing:

* Caring for leather shoes or boots
* Oiling wooden countertops or cutting boards
* Watching birds in Strathcona Park
* Standing at the lookout behind the Supreme Court
* Eating a bowl of pasta with sauce
* Watching an episode of *Star Trek* (any episode, any series)
* Looking at maps, like the one of Ottawa hanging above my desk
* Skimming through a book I’ve previously annotated[^annotated-books]
* Sketching letters (especially a double-story ‘a’)
* Walking (just about anywhere, but especially [these routes](/study/walking-routes/){:link})
* Eating a clementine in the winter
* Handwashing a few items of clothing
* Holding *Madness, Rack, and Honey*, by Mary Ruefle, in my hands (it’s the perfectly sized book)

[^annotated-books]: So any book I’ve read, really.
