In his book _Consolations_, David Whyte provides stunning, upending definitions of words like anger, forgiveness, and maturity. I struggle to pick my favourite portions to excerpt; I reckon Maria Popova had the same trouble.

Anger:

> What we name as anger is actually only the incoherent physical incapacity to sustain this deep form of care in our outer daily life; the unwillingness to be large enough and generous enough to hold what we love helplessly in our bodies or our mind with the clarity and breadth of our whole being. …
>
> What we have named as anger on the surface is the violent outer response to our own inner powerlessness, a powerlessness connected to such a profound sense of rawness and care that it can find no proper outer body or identity or voice, or way of life to hold it. 

(Compare this with [Ursula Franklin’s definition of violence as resourcelessness](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/franklin-definitions/).)

Forgiveness:

> FORGIVENESS is a heartache and difficult to achieve because strangely, it not only refuses to eliminate the original wound, but actually draws us closer to its source. …
> To forgive is to assume a larger identity than the person who was first hurt, to mature and bring to fruition an identity that can put its arm, not only around the afflicted one within but also around the memories seared within us by the original blow and through a kind of psychological virtuosity, extend our understanding to one who first delivered it. 

Maturity:

> MATURITY is the ability to live fully and equally in multiple contexts; most especially, the ability, despite our grief and losses, to courageously inhabit the past the present and the future all at once. The wisdom that comes from maturity is recognized through a disciplined refusal to choose between or isolate three powerful dynamics that form human identity: what has happened, what is happening now and what is about to occur.

(These three dynamics I call “[time’s triptych](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/69-returning-home/)”.)
