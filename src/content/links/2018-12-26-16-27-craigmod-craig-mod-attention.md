Craig Mod on consciously creating rules to re-strengthen his capacity to pay attention. Excerpts:

> There are a thousand beautiful ways to start the day that don’t begin with looking at a phone. And yet so few of us choose to do so. 

> Today, I could live on Twitter all day, everyday, convincing myself I was being productive. Or, at least inducing the chemicals in the mind that make me feel like I’m being productive. … Largely pushing nothing in the world forward. 

> The internet goes off before bed. The internet doesn’t return until after lunch. That’s it. Reasonable rules. I’m too weak to handle the unreasonable.
>
> So I deploy blunt, simple tools. Time boxed disconnection has proven to be both generative and — most importantly — sustainable. 

> Wherever you fall on the spectrum of leveraging the network for social good, having control over your attention can only make your efforts stronger. I refuse to believe otherwise. Take the morning. Hell, just take the first hour of the morning. Make a plan. Own your attention.

> Attention is a muscle. It must be exercised. Though, attention is duplicitous — it doesn’t feel like a muscle. And exercising it doesn’t result in an appreciably healthier looking body. But it does result in a sense of grounding, feeling rational, control of your emotions — a healthy mind.
