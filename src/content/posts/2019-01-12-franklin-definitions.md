_The Ursula Franklin Reader: Pacifism as a Map_ collects a number of Franklin’s speeches and published works on a range of subjects that were core to her life, including pacifism, feminism, technology, and education. I find her simply spoken definitions clarifying, and offer them below for future reference and reflection.

## “The Indivisibility of Peace”

> Peace is the absence of fear. (76)

> Justice, in both the temporal and the spiritual sense, is a guarantee against the arbitrariness of power that is the source of so much justifiable fear. (76)


## “Stormy Weather: Reflections on Violence as an Environment”

> The term “violence,” as used in this discussion, can be defined as the use of force to establish or maintain otherwise dysfunctional relations of power and authority. I feel that this definition holds for physical, verbal, or economic violence, and that it can be applied in most places where violence occurs. (260)

> Violence, clearly, is resourcelessness; it is the brutal response of those who see force as their only approach to conflict. Non-violence, in contrast, is resourcefulness; it is the cultivation of and the reliance on a broad range of approaches to conflict resolution. (261)

> Even in situations where we have been unable to prevent violence, it is necessary to articulate our standards and principles and reaffirm that violence is not a normal human reaction, it is an unacceptable response to change. (261)
