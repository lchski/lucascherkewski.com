* Pen is better than pencil—the latter fades quickly
* It’s best to use blue ink, for it stands out
* I can write big, small, and I’ve many types of scrawl
* The guilty feeling fades fast
* Though I may never reference the notes I write, making them helps me better understand
  what I’m reading *in that moment*
* Some of my friends apparently enjoy reading my notes
* It now feels weird (wrong, even) to read a book without a pen in hand
* Books with wide margins are the best

some time ago; I believe it was that post which convinced me to pick up the pen. I also enjoy
[this speech by William Lyon Phelps](http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/phelps.htm){:link}
on the subject.
