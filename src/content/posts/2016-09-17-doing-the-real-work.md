There is a crucial distinction between the illusion of work, and work itself—a situation Eco calls “the alibi of photocopies”.
Mistaking the former for the latter makes it easy to lull ourselves into a false sense of accomplishment, even as the
real task still lies ahead.
 
I also enjoy Eco’s suggestion that to really know something *is to own it*. The books that adorn my shelves sit as a
visual reminder of some of the knowledge at my disposal—both knowledge that’s already owned, and potential future acquisitions.
