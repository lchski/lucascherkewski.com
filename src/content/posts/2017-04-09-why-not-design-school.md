*What do you study?* Political science and history.

*But don’t you design websites?* Yeah.

*So why aren’t you at design school, or studying computer science?*

This last question usually trips me up.

I struggle to explain why I study the humanities while I work in design and tech. I reach for explanations posing the humanities as “studying my subject.” (A designer’s work is ultimately always about humans.) I protest that you don’t need a design or computer science degree to work in those fields. I argue that it’s essential as a designer to have other sources of expertise to draw from. While not wrong, those answers feel insufficient.

Enter Michael Bierut.

Two essays of his answer the question more effectively than I ever have:

1. [Warning: May Contain Non-Design Content](http://designobserver.com/feature/warning-may-contain-non-design-content/4137){:link}
2. [Why Designers Can’t Think](http://risd.generic.cx/why.html){:link}

I came across them excitedly, because they word my thoughts so well.
Maybe they’ll help others understand why I’m not at design school.
