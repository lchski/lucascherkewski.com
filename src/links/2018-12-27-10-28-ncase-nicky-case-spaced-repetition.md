Nicky Case (in an awesome interactive format) explains how memory is a muscle, something you need to constantly push just to the edge to strengthen. Case describes a method (spaced repetition) to sustain this memory training.

I’ve always found spaced repetition to be a rewarding approach, but rarely kept up with it after a test. Since reading this piece two months ago, I’ve been slowly expanding my Anki library and practicing each day—it feels good. Well worth the time to go through Case’s whole overview. And it’s fun! Remember: memory is the mother of inspiration!
