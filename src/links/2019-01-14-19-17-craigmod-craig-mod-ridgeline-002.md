I’m enjoying [Craig Mod’s new weekly newsletter on walking, _Ridgeline_](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/).

Two favourite bits from the latest issue (emphasis mine):

> _Rewalking grounds the walker, allows the walker more noticing._ I’ve done bits of the Kumano a half-dozen times now. But to call them the same route is a disservice to nature — they’re never the same (and I don’t mean in the metaphysical sense), certainly season by season, but also year by year.

> The path shifts. Not a lot, just enough to be new. But not new enough to need to ask. And so slowly, _it becomes a tiny country of your own_.

I started reading Rebecca Mead’s _My Life in Middlemarch_ last night. Mead celebrates how a book, through reading and rereading, can become a part of us. Mod’s point—one I share, and practice through [a series of familiar walking routes](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/walking-routes/)—is that walking and rewalking a particular path can do the same for us as reading and rereading a book.

(Choosing two favourite bits from such a short newsletter means that basically all of it is my favourite—this is true and I have no regrets. If you’re interested, [check out the biographical issue 001](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/001/) and consider subscribing.)
