Researchers from the Nielsen Norman Group share findings from a study on the introduction of digital media to fill our lives. The summary? “Many people use digital media to avoid silence or empty time.”

> They clearly were not interested in the plot of the movie itself. The movie was a place for them to rest their attention in between other activities.
>
> Some reported feeling an almost compulsive need to have some audio on, effectively filling the silence in their lives.

> While many participants reported feeling the need to have some sort of audio in the background during their silent moments, others reported a more intense version of this phenomenon: the need to fill _all the empty moments_ in their lives with some activity to avoid boredom or downtime. This behavior fills the ‘silence’ in a figurative way — people use their devices to keep their minds constantly occupied.
>
> In many cases, this desire to kill time contributed to frequent interactions with a device, even when the user had no specific task in mind. The content users turned to wasn’t just social media: it also included activities like checking email, the weather, or the news. The content itself didn’t matter — users felt compelled to be doing _something_.

More on this to come, connecting to a few books I read recently, [including Michael Harris’s _Solitude_](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/michael-harris-solitude/).
