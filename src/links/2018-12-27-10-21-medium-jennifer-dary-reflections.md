Jen Dary (founder of [Plucky](https://www.beplucky.com/)) reflects on her first year running her own consulting business. I appreciate Dary’s honest reflections (very much in the “share what you know” spirit of the web).

> I boiled down the point of my existence on this planet into six words: _I help people find their way_. It wasn’t a business plan, but it was a purpose. And somehow I trusted that the details around monetizing one’s purpose were logistical and completely solvable and that I was smart and driven enough to do it.

> “Oh Jen, you’re not signing clients right now,” he said. “_You’re planting seeds._ Whenever things get slow, you gotta go out there and plant seeds.”
