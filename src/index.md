Hia!

Welcome to my home on the internet. Nice to have you here.

This is what I care about:

- _Remembering the humans._ Everything we do comes back to people—care for them.
- _Questioning arbitrary barriers._ Disciplines are human constructions—mix them.
- _Listening._ Nobody has every answer—consult widely and humbly.

I work on projects that attempt to combine those principles, usually by building thoughtful digital tools to improve non-digital experiences.

This site holds what [I’ve written](/study/) and what [I’m reading online](/links/). I wrote [a manifesto](/study/manifesto/) to suggest what a personal site is to me. You can learn about [what I’m doing now](/now/).

P.S. I really do view this as my home on the internet. Feel free to come in and make yourself comfortable; explore these public workings of my brain and get to know me a bit better.

If anything here strikes you, don’t hesitate to [get in touch](/contact/)! I look forward to hearing from you :)
