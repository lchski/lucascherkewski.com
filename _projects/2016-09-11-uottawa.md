[uOttawa](https://www.uottawa.ca){:link}’s tools for course selection aren’t great. I made ones that work for me.
{: .f2}

When I started choosing courses for university, I was disappointed to see that all my school offered were long, dense
lists of courses, with no ability to sort them.

Take, for example, [the list of political science courses offered by uOttawa](http://www.uottawa.ca/academic/info/regist/calendars/courses/POL.html):

![A dense table, coupled with a list of courses in English and French. The courses have descriptions beneath](/assets/img/uottawa-pol.png)

This page lists *all* political science courses offered by uOttawa. Not only does this include first, second, third,
and fourth year courses, but it also includes courses in both English and French. uOttawa is a fully bilingual university.
Whereas a unilingual university might have 87 undergraduate political science courses for the four years, uOttawa has *174*!

Combing through this to make course selections is daunting. Not only are you faced with courses irrelevant to you based on your
progress (a first-year student can’t take fourth-year courses, and a fourth-year student probably doesn’t care for first-year
courses), but, depending on your linguistic capacity, you must also wade through a list of courses in a language you can’t understand!
I saw great potential for improvement.

## Scraping the course data
{:h2}

My first step was to obtain the course data. It was all there, on the pages for each discipline, but my sights were set
higher than mere style tweaks; I wanted to build new functionality on top of this course data, to make it easier to find
and compare courses. For this I needed structured data in a format more usable than HTML.

Fortunately, the markup was structured enough that I could write a [downloader and parser](https://github.com/lchski/uo-course-data){:link}
which could scrape the courses for any given discipline at uOttawa. This I then converted to JSON, with a generic “course”
schema.[^schema] With the structured data in hand, it was time to create an interface to view it, to realize the real
value of this endeavour.
 
*[JSON]: JavaScript Object Notation
[^schema]:
	The schema is intentionally generic. If someone wanted to get course data for another school, they could rewrite the
	downloader and parser to suit, and output to the same structure. This would allow them to take advantage of the course
	comparator I created, using their own school’s data!

## Displaying the course data
{:h2}

In order to display the data, I knew I had to build an interface that improved on what I already had available. To this
end, I came up with a few goals. The interface had to be:

* Fast
* Filterable
* Searchable

I had always given front-end JavaScript frameworks (AngularJS, React, etc) a hard rap, without giving them a fair chance. 
In this case, I didn’t have the same constraints that usually steer me away from these frameworks: this project was conceived
entirely for my own purposes, so I wasn’t worried about people with less-than-evergreen browsers being hit with roadblocks
because of the framework I’d chosen.

I chose AngularJS to embark on this project, in large part thanks to my friend [Roy Sivan](http://www.roysivan.com){:link}’s
consistent work touting its benefits. It made wiring the UI a breeze, and was a blast to learn. (This was Angular 1.x.
Trying to adapt my head to Angular 2.x afterwards hurt my head a fair bit.) This project was also one of the first for which
I used [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io){:link}; it’s now my go-to for any project when I need to quickly design an interface.
